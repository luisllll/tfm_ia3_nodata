Financial conditions continued to tighten, driven by higher yields on Treasury securities as well as by lower equity prices and a stronger dollar, which themselves partly reflected higher interest rates. Because earnings expectations had held up well in recent months, the effect of higher interest rates on equity prices likely took place largely through valuations.\n",

      "Staff analysis and responses from the Open Market Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants suggested that the bulk of the increase since July in the 10-year nominal Treasury yield could be attributed to a higher term premium, though higher policy expectations at longer horizons could also have played a role. The manager also noted that liquidity conditions in the Treasury market had not changed materially since July, suggesting that Treasury market liquidity had not been an important driver of the increase in yields.\n",

Both market pricing and responses to the Desk's surveys implied that market participants expected that the federal funds rate was at or near its peak and would be held there at least until the June 2024 FOMC meeting; there was a roughly 30 percent probability of a 25 basis point increase at either the December or January FOMC meeting. Regarding balance sheet policy, the surveys showed that respondents had pushed out the date they expected balance sheet runoff to stop, perhaps partly in response to policymakers' communications that balance sheet runoff could continue even after the Committee begins to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate.\n",

      "The manager then turned to developments in money markets and Desk operations. Balance sheet runoff continued to proceed smoothly over the intermeeting period through reduced holdings of Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities. The continued repayment by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation of discount window loans extended to banks that were placed into receivership also contributed to reduced Federal Reserve assets. On the liabilities side of the balance sheet, usage of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility declined further, as money market mutual funds continued to absorb new Treasury bill issuance and appeared to increase investment in the private market for repurchase agreements (repos) as well. Overall, the reduced usage of the ON RRP facility released more reserves than the reduction in Federal Reserve assets and the increase in the Treasury General Account absorbed. On net, reserves expanded over the period, and available indicators pointed to them remaining abundant. Primary dealers indicated that reserves were projected to remain within their recent range for the next several quarters. The manager also noted that 23 banks, in addition to all primary dealers, were already counterparties to the standing repo facility (SRF) and that several more were in the onboarding process. Together, these banks held the vast majority of SRF-eligible securities in the banking system. The SRF, in addition to the discount window, may therefore prove helpful for supplying liquidity to the banking system should funding pressures emerge.\n",

Participants assessed that while labor market conditions remained tight, they had eased since earlier in the year, partly as a result of recent increases in labor supply. Participants judged that the current stance of monetary policy was restrictive and was putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. In addition, they noted that financial conditions had tightened significantly in recent months. Participants noted that inflation had moderated over the past year but stressed that current inflation remained unacceptably high and well above the Committee's longer-run goal of 2 percent. They also stressed that further evidence would be required for them to be confident that inflation was clearly on a path to the Committee's 2 percent objective.

A couple of these participants commented that the aggregate household sector may have more financial resources than previously thought, which could help account for the strength in spending.

Higher Treasury yields contributed to an increase in 30-year mortgage rates to levels not seen in many years and led to higher corporate borrowing rates. Many participants observed that a range of measures suggested that the rise in longer-term yields had been driven primarily or substantially by a rise in the term premiums on Treasury securities. Participants generally viewed factors such as a fiscal outlook that suggested greater future supply of Treasury securities than previously thought and increased uncertainty about the economic and policy outlooks as likely having contributed to the rise in the term premiums. Some participants noted that the rise in longer-term yields may also have been driven by expectations for a higher path of the federal funds rate in light of the surprising resilience of the economy or a possible rise in the neutral policy rate. Participants highlighted that longer-term yields could be volatile and that the factors behind the recent increase, as well as their persistence, were uncertain.

      "In their discussion of financial stability, participants observed that the banking system was sound and resilient and that banking stresses had subsided. However, many participants commented that unrealized losses on assets resulting from the rise in longer-term interest rates, significant reliance by some banks on uninsured deposits, and increased funding costs at banks warranted monitoring. Many participants also commented on risks associated with a potential sharp decline in CRE valuations, which could adversely affect some banks and other financial institutions. Several participants noted potential cyber risks and emphasized the importance of firms, particularly providers of critical infrastructure, being prepared to recover from such threats. A few participants also discussed the importance of monitoring Treasury market functioning and potential vulnerabilities posed by the amount of leverage being used by hedge funds in this market. In addition, several participants emphasized the need for banks to establish readiness to use Federal Reserve liquidity facilities and for the Federal Reserve to ensure its own readiness to provide liquidity during periods of stress.\n",

      "In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy actions at this meeting, participants noted that economic activity expanded at a strong pace in the third quarter and had been resilient. While the labor market remained tight, job gains had moderated, on balance, since earlier in the year, and there were continuing signs that supply and demand in the labor market were coming into better balance. While inflation had moderated since the middle of last year, it remained well above the Committee's longer-run goal of 2 percent, and participants remained resolute in their commitment to bring inflation down to the Committee's 2 percent objective. Participants also noted that tighter financial and credit conditions facing households and businesses would likely weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation, al­though the extent of these effects remained uncertain. Participants commented on the significant tightening in financial conditions in recent months, driven by higher longer-term yields, with many noting that it was uncertain whether this tightening of financial conditions would persist and to what extent it reflected expectations for tighter policy or other factors. Amid these economic conditions, all participants judged it appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent at this meeting. Participants judged that maintaining this restrictive stance of policy at this meeting would support further progress toward the Committee's goals while allowing more time to gather additional information to evaluate this progress. All participants agreed that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings, as described in the previously announced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet.\n",

      "In discussing the policy outlook, participants continued to judge that it was critical that the stance of monetary policy be kept sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective over time. All participants agreed that the Committee was in a position to proceed carefully and that policy decisions at every meeting would continue to be based on the totality of incoming information and its implications for the economic outlook as well as the balance of risks. Participants noted that further tightening of monetary policy would be appropriate if incoming information indicated that progress toward the Committee's inflation objective was insufficient. Participants expected that the data arriving in coming months would help clarify the extent to which the disinflation process was continuing, aggregate demand was moderating in the face of tighter financial and credit conditions, and labor markets were reaching a better balance between demand and supply. Participants noted the importance of continuing to communicate clearly about the Committee's data-dependent approach and its firm commitment to bring inflation down to 2 percent.\n",

Participants also observed that the continuing process of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet was an important part of the overall approach to achieving their macroeconomic objectives. A few participants noted that the process of balance sheet runoff could continue for some time, even after the Committee begins to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate.

      "Participants discussed several risk-management considerations that could bear on future policy decisions. Participants generally judged that, with the stance of monetary policy in restrictive territory, risks to the achievement of the Committee's goals had become more two sided. But with inflation still well above the Committee's longer-run goal and the labor market remaining tight, most participants continued to see upside risks to inflation. These risks included the possibility that the imbalance of aggregate demand and supply could persist longer than expected and slow the progress on inflation, geopolitical tensions and risks emanating from global oil markets, the effects of a tight housing market on shelter inflation, and the potential for more limited declines in goods prices. Many participants commented that even though economic activity had been resilient and the labor market had continued to be strong, downside risks to economic activity remained. Such risks included potentially larger-than-expected effects of the tightening in financial and credit conditions on aggregate demand and on bank, business, and household balance sheets; continued weakness in the CRE sector; and potential disruptions to global oil markets.\n",

      "Madam Chair, this completes my part of the Desk briefing. We would be happy to answer questions before moving on to Lorie's part.e discussion of this service in the October minutes generated considerable interest amongst Fed watchers. As you recall, SBAs are designed to improve competition in the deposit market. The mechanism through which they would improve competition is similar to, but different in important respects from, the use of RRPs. Many market participants interpreted the discussion in the minutes as suggesting SBAs would receive important regulatory relief which would substantially lower the balance sheet costs of attracting funds into such accounts. As you know, such relief was not part of the plan for the service, although some other types of regulatory decisions were required for SBAs to be viable. In addition, various system changes would be required. The staff currently judges that in light of the competing priorities related to normalization and the small marginal effect SBAs would likely have on interest rate control given the readiness of other tools, further work on implementing SBAs should be shelved for now. This judgment is supported by the reaction to a request for feedback on continuing work on SBAs in a memo that Bill English and I sent to the Committee.ceived possibility of remaining at or returning to the zero lower bound along with other downside risks. In 2016 and 2017, this accounts for around 30 to 35 basis points of the difference between the median SEP dot and the market-implied rate. Finally, the light red bars represent the difference between the mean of respondents' federal funds rate probability distributions and the market-implied rate, a measure of risk premiums in futures rates. These differences are very small at earlier horizons but increase substantially in 2017 to a negative term premium of around 55 basis points.\n",

      "11 of 219 16­17, 2014ns for Simon? President Fisher. MR. FISHER. Thank you, Madam Chair. I have a short question, and I also have a clarification which will require a longer question. On slide number 10, you have the high yield OAS. And if I did my numbers right, just looking at the red line, the broad index is off 22 percent. If memory serves, energy is off about 68 percent. You mentioned it's about 18 percent of the index, I think--it's a heavy weight. I just wanted to clarify that. The index altogether is off by 22 percent, and, excluding energy, it would be something around 15 or 16 percent. I just want to clarify that. So it's mainly energy-driven. MR. POTTER. I'm not as good with numbers in my head as you are. That sounds about right. MR. FISHER. Well, you're much better with bigger numbers than I am, but just for clarification I think that's correct. So we read about panic--which we have been warning about, Madam Chair, at this table--at least I have, for quite some time. I believe we are beginning to see that, but it is heavily concentrated with marginal energy operators. I think that needs to be understood, and I'm going to talk a little bit about oil during the economic go-round. I just want to put that in context. And then, with regard to numbers, you did send around to the research directors an excellent, very insightful memo which gives more background to your slide number 14. And these are numbers I know you're familiar with, so I just want to make sure I understand them, because you referenced them just now. MR. POTTER. Okay.\n",

And then, in this memo, which, again, was superb as far as I'm concerned, but here is where I get into the stuff I just want to make sure I understand and my colleagues understand. So we estimate paydown reinvestments from mortgage-backed securities for 2015 will be approximately $20 billion per month. MR. POTTER. Maybe a little bit higher, but about that level. MR. FISHER. And your memo says that's 25 percent of gross issuance and three times net issuance. MR. POTTER. Correct. MR. FISHER. That's as long as we keep our mortgage-backed securities at about $1.8 trillion, until we change our reinvestment policy. Then, in the memo you use the prepayment speed projections of BlackRock Solutions, and we project that by August 2021, we will have an MBS portfolio of $980 billion and a 90 percent confidence band around that of $700 billion to $1.16 trillion. So, in other words, we'd halve our mortgage-backed security portfolio in a period of five years. The stated intention of the Committee right now is to not let these reinvestments roll off until after we have raised rates, whenever that is going to be, whenever we begin to normalize.\n",

Then, concomitantly, on excess reserves, you noted that they will be reduced from their current level. We thought at the peak it would be $2.95 trillion, but it's $2.5 trillion, whatever the number is. Where is it now? MR. POTTER. It depends on the take-up in the TDF and the overnight RRP. So because the $400 billion TDF rolled off, we should add probably $400 billion to that number. So it's around $2.8 trillion to $2.9 trillion. MR. FISHER. Okay. And we expect to reduce it to what you call the normal level of $100 billion by mid-2021. So over a six-year period, we will have gone from $2.9 trillion to $100 billion in excess reserves. I just want to make sure I understand the numbers. That's a lot. MR. POTTER. Yes. MR. FISHER. Thank you. I hope the Committee realizes all these numbers. This is very important to me. That's asking a lot. To reduce by that size over that short of a time period, it's going to require our successors, meaning President Plosser's and my successors, and you all and your successors, to be very artful--and I'm trying to think through, how are those excess reserves going to be reduced by 95 percent? That's a big number. I would like the Committee just to start thinking about that. I would urge everybody to read this research-director memo.

President Bullard. MR. BULLARD. Thank you, Madam Chair. My question is on exhibit 1, panels 5 and 6, which are about U.S. inflation expectations. I'm looking at panel 5, and it shows that the primary dealer inflation expectation, five-year, five-year-forward, is 2.2 percent. And then I look at panel 6 and it says, if I'm interpreting this correctly, that the primary dealers are saying that their expectations went down 17 basis points on expected inflation. No? Is that not right? MR. POTTER. This is a question that came up last time. We asked them for their view of what CPI inflation will be five years forward, over the next five years after that. Then we asked them to explain what the market pricing is. So we are trying to get their beliefs or understanding of what in market sentiment is driving the drop in inflation compensation. MR. BULLARD. Okay. But, you know, panel 5 says none of the primary dealers changed any of their expectations about inflation. That's what that light blue line says, I guess. MR. POTTER. That is correct. MR. BULLARD. But, nevertheless, there are other traders in the market whose expectations--so that sounds like a money-making arbitrage opportunity for primary dealers.\n",

They tell you in a survey, \"I haven't changed my inflation expectations, but I'm not willing to go bet against the market.\" MR. POTTER. That's right. MR. BULLARD. Yes. Thank you. MR. ENGLISH. I think that this gets back to something that we learned during the taper tantrum--that what we mean by \"market expectations\" isn't really clear. There isn't a person who is the market who has a set of expectations. There are a bunch of diverse market participants who each have their own expectations, and you can have a situation in which the average market participant has a set of expectations, but the marginal investor has a different set of expectations. And that is something that we try to tease out with these surveys and in conversations with people and by reading newsletters. But it just is a complicated problem. MR. BULLARD. Well, I think it's a point well taken. Obviously, there is a diverse set of expectations out there, but I think, from the Committee's point of view--sometimes we look at our primary dealer survey and we say, \"Well, this is kind of the authoritative judgment on whether these expectations are really changing or not.\" And I don't think that's necessarily the way that we want to interpret the data.\n",

I'm going to blame it on the very interesting charts on the SEP dots four through seven that distracted me as I tried to extract a little bit of what that was. So I might have missed the explanation later on. You started off in chart 1 describing how the 10-year rates had gone down so much more than anybody was expecting at the beginning of the year, and I don't quite recall the explanation offered as to why they have gone down so much. I think at one point you mentioned anticipated easier monetary policy. You probably mentioned lower inflation and oil supply, weak demand was mentioned in another case. Do you want to give me an executive summary of that? MR. POTTER. The forecast error for the U.S. 10-year is not that big. The absolute error over the past 10 years is about 93 basis points. For the bund, I think it is more like 80 basis points, and that is consistent with thinking something will change in the euro area. So one of the reasons to show this is to remind ourselves that forecasting the future is really hard, and even if we get these experts, they are going to be wrong a lot. The second one is to show that there is a distinct pattern here, which is easier policy probably in Germany and Japan than people thought was going to happen at the start of the year, a big drop in the price of oil, and the U.S. doing relatively better.

If the legal, credit, and compliance assessments of all applicants prove satisfactory, the total number of expanded RRP counterparties will increase to 142. This number incorporates the fact that we had one firm withdraw as a counterparty during the intermeeting period.

In the end, it's a wash for core prices.

But I don't think that's something that I necessarily would expect to see in the next few months. MR. EVANS. So we're looking for a pretty bright economic outlook next year, and the international situation seems to be relatively optimistic compared with other things you might write down. That's not likely to also have implications for the term premiums or the liquidity premiums? MR. ENGLISH. It certainly could, but what we've tried to do in the Tealbook kind of regression exercise is, looking at the term premiums or other premiums in this model, what are they functions of? You get something out of volatility. You get something out of some particular market factors in these markets, but they're hard to explain, I think. What the model is telling us is that there are specific factors in the TIPS market and the nominals market that are moving around the TIPS-based inflation compensation independent of movements in inflation expectations, and I think that could be true for a while depending on how durable those factors are that are moving around the numbers in the TIPS yields.\n",

Thank you, Madam Chair. I have a comment on the line of questioning that President Evans had about the term premiums and liquidity premiums. My intuition is that if you looked at the zero-coupon inflation swaps as opposed to TIPS breakevens, you should typically not see as much liquidity movements in those zero-coupon inflation swaps. But the relative liquidity effects on TIPS versus Treasuries are much more pronounced than on the different sides of a zero-coupon inflation swap position. So that should help on the liquidity part. On the risk premium part, I think that as the memo from the Minneapolis Fed indicated, those are reflective, in our view, of actual fundamentals. And so there is no reason to see those unwind relatively rapidly. I had a question about the exercise in SIGMA on exhibit 7. I am puzzling over this, and I can't quite figure it out.

That model shows broadly similar results in the sense that it also shows 10-year expected inflation hasn't declined a lot, at least based on their decomposition. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Yes. I'm not as familiar with that model as I should be. Maybe I'm misremembering, but I thought in the actual data on the five-year, five-year-forward that you get out of the zero-coupon inflation swaps, you see that expected inflation has fallen, but not as much as what you get off breakevens. MR. POTTER. So it's chart 7. But what you'd usually expect is that there would be some disconnect between the fall in the swap-implied measure and the TIPS-implied measure, the cash market. We're not seeing a large movement there. That doesn't mean that it isn't the liquidity features, because if you talk to the swap traders, a lot of how they price this is what has happened in the cash market.

Such a decline would imply a higher likelihood of periods when nominal rates will be at the zero lower bound and inflation will be below target. If inflation is expected to be near 2 percent during normal times but below 2 percent during zero-lower-bound periods and the odds of zero-lower-bound episodes are increased, we would expect to see inflation compensation drift down. I think this interpretation is perhaps in line with President Kocherlakota's memo to us on this topic. In this regard, I found the Tealbook analysis pertaining to the cost of insurance against inflation outcomes quite interesting.

We need to talk more about the conditions under which we are going to lift off, make our policy state dependent, and not allow it to pile up on expectations of particular dates. We know that, in the past, that's frustrated us, and the more we've relied on time-related guidance, we have always come to regret it. I think it was President Bullard who suggested that, once we get \"patient\" in the statement, it's going to be yet another word that we're going to have to figure out how to get out from under and worry about the signals it's going to give when the time comes. So I believe this path that we're on to do it this way is not serving our policy well, no matter whether you want to lift off later or you want to lift off earlier. Thank you, Madam Chair.m where we would like to be, and, indeed, I don't really think that deflation is the serious problem here. We do want to get our target back up, but I do believe expectations are anchored in a way that will continue.\n",

We're asked in the SEP what conditions would look like when we lift off. We weren't asked, \"What would you need to see to lift off?\" Those are two different things. Some of us might lift off on a given date even if conditions were a little different than the forecast path we've written down, given the history we've come into these meetings with. Do you see what I'm saying?nd, it wouldn't be inconsistent with the strength of the signal that dropping \"patient\" is going to provide for us to essentially say, \"All right.

      "151 of 21916­17, 2014ou. President George. MS. GEORGE. Thank you, Madam Chair. Yesterday's go-round reflected general confidence in the economy's ability to sustain growth with labor market strength and stable inflation expectations. This narrative, although not without noted risk and remaining weak spots, such as housing or tepid wage gains, seems to me inconsistent with a policy that continues to support negative real interest rates and is slow to normalize. So while I would have preferred to signal an earlier liftoff, as do most policy rules in the Tealbook B, I can support alternative B today and its attempt to lean forward with language changes that offer additional flexibility and the opportunity to underscore conditionality on a path to normalization. As the Tealbook B, notes and as President Lockhart and others have mentioned, the history associated with the proposed language around \"patience\" may give the public some sense that we are looking to a sequence of guidance changes from that period. So I think the Chair's plan to emphasize data dependence and conditionality about liftoff will be especially important today. In that regard, I support both approaches that you've outlined around the explanation of \"patient\" and characterizing participant views. Also, in paragraph 1, I would prefer to characterize labor market conditions as having improved \"further,\" rather than using \"somewhat\" in that characterization. Thank you, Madam Chair.

I wouldn't announce that here, because it telescopes a little bit.

Governor Powell, for example, said on page 158, \"It may well be that in December, depending on conditions and expectations, we can take [`considerable time'] out of the statement completely.\" President Mester said, \"My hope is that in December we will find a way to omit the reference to the conclusion of the purchase program in our forward guidance [and] replace `considerable time.' \" Then she went on to say that we will know from the December SEP if our policy intentions have shifted. We say we are, as President Lacker mentioned, data dependent. At that meeting in October, we added language, which I thought was wise and therefore voted for, emphasizing that policy would be data driven, not date driven, and trying to take that date-driven edge off it. If our claims that policy is data dependent are to have credibility at all, I believe we must signal that our expectations for liftoff have shifted forward.

I think about the two mandates as lexicographic, so if inflation is running below target, I don't need to look at the employment mandate at all. You're just trying to get inflation back to target. Or if the outlook for inflation is running above target, then the employment mandate comes into play.

So it doesn't feel like a circumstance in which things can get away from us, whereas we are at the zero lower bound, we've got deflationary risks, at least in other parts of the world, and thus, again, my instinct is that the risks of going too quickly outweigh the risks of waiting a bit. And President Kocherlakota raised a very good point: Why don't we think about going back, even if we have increased? Well, here another consideration would be, what does that do to the credibility of the institution in the eyes of the market if we lift off one month and, a few months later, are saying, \"No, actually, we need to go back to zero again\"? reactions, because it would have already been sufficiently anticipated, both with economic developments and with things that the Chair had said.

It would be a big surprise to the market. This is a tremendously important event in our history, and it ought not to be thrown together in that way.

The danger is that markets take signal from the change in wording when none is intended, and, of course, we know from past experience how disruptive unintended signals can be.

The second question is, you know, really, how high to raise the policy rate, and that's really the question that we're still on here. We're very focused on that.

So that's really the next question, and that's what people are thinking about and talking about. And I would just say this, we are seeing, you know, strong growth that appears to be moderating, We're seeing a labor market that is coming back into balance by so many measures, and we're seeing inflation making real progress. These are the things we've been wanting to see. We can't know -- we still have a ways to go. No one is declaring victory. That would be premature, and we can't be guaranteed of this progress. So, we're moving carefully in making that assessment of whether we need to do more or not. And that's really the question that we're on, but of course, the other question, the question of when will it become appropriate to begin dialing back the amount of policy restraint in place, that begins to come into view, and is clearly a topic of discussion out in the world and also a discussion for us at our meeting today.\n",

I think there's always a probability that there will be a recession in the next year, and it's a meaningful probability no matter what the economy is doing. So it's always a real possibility. The question is, is it -- so it's a possibility here. I have always felt, since the beginning, that there was a possibility, because of the unusual situation, that the economy could cool off in a way that enabled inflation to come down without the kind of large job losses that have often been associated with high inflation and tightening cycles. So far, that's what we're seeing. That's what many forecasters on and off the committee are seeing. This result is not guaranteed. It is far to early to declare victory, and there are certainly risks. It's certainly possible that the economy will behave in an unexpected way. It has done that repeatedly through the post -- in the post-pandemic period. Nonetheless, where we are is we see the things that I mentioned.\n",

      "forecasters predicted very weak growth or a recession. Not only did that not happen, we actually had a very strong year, and that was a combination of strong demand but also real gains on the supply side. So this was the year when labor force participation picked up, where immigration picked up, where the distortions to supply and demand from the pandemic, you know, the shortages and the bottlenecks, really began to unwind. So we had significant supply side gains with strong demand, and we got what looks like a two and half percent plus or a little more than that growth year at a time when potential growth this year might even have been higher than that, just because of the healing on the supply side. So that was a surprise to just about everybody. I think the inflation forecast is roughly what people wrote down a year ago but in a very different setting, and I would say the labor market because of the stronger growth has also been significantly better. If you look back at the SEP from a year ago, there was a significant increase in unemployment. It didn't really happen. We're still at 3.7 percent. So we've seen, you know, strong growth, still a tight labor market, but one that's coming back into balance with the -- with support from the supply side, a greater supply of labor. It's a -- you know, that's what we see, and I think that combination was not anticipated broadly.\n",

      "CHAIR POWELL. Nothing quite that mechanical is happening. The SEP really is a bottoms-up, built from the bottom up, right. So I think people are looking at what's happening in the economy, and I think if you look at the big difference from September in the SEP, the expectations for inflation this year, both headline and core, have come down, you know, really significantly in three months. That's a big piece of this. At the same time, growth has turned out to be very strong in the third quarter, is slowing, we believe, as appropriate, and we've had several labor market reports, which suggest, again, significant progress toward greater balance across a very -- a broad range of indicators. You're seeing so many of the indicators coming back to normal, not all of them. But, so I think people look at that, and they write down their -basically, each individual writes down a forecast and a rate forecast that goes with that forecast. We tabulate them and publish it. So it's not -- it isn't -- you ask about real rates, I take it, you know, that is something that we're very conscious of and aware of and monitor, and it's certainly a big part of -- it's a part of how we think about things but really is broader financial conditions that matter. And as you well know, it's so hard to know exactly, you know, what the real rate is or exactly how tight policy is at any given time. So, you couldn't follow that like it was a rule and think that you would get the right answer all the time, but it's certainly something that we're focused on, and indeed, if you look at the projections, I think the expectation would be that the real rate is declining as we move forward.\n",

One of the things we're moving carefully about is that decision over, that assessment, really, over whether we've done enough, really. And you see that people are not running down rate hikes. That's us thinking that we have done enough but not feeling that really strongly confidently and not wanting to take the possibility of a rate hike off the table. Nonetheless, it's not the base case anymore, obviously, as it was, you know, 60, 90 days ago. So that how we're approaching things, and you know, as I mentioned, we wrote down this SEP, and it talks about, people have individual assessments of when it will be appropriate to start to dial back on the tight policy we have in place, and that's a discussion we'll be having going forward.

If growth were to surprise us again in the way that it has for years now by being stronger than expected next year, would it still be possible to cut rates, or put another way, is below-trend growth necessary to cut rates, or would continued progress on inflation alone be sufficient? CHAIR POWELL. So we'll look at the totality of the data. Growth is one thing. So is inflation. So is labor market data. So we'd look at the -- as we make decisions about policy changes going forward, we're going to look at all those things and particularly as they affect the outlook. So it's ultimately all about the outlook and the balance of risk as well. So that's what we'd be looking for. If we have stronger growth, you know, that'll be good for people. That'll be good for the labor market. It might actually mean that it takes a little longer to get inflation down to 2 percent. We will get it down to 2 percent, but you know, if we see stronger growth, we will set policy according to what we actually see, and so, that's how I would answer. JEANNA SMIALEK. I guess the question I'm asking, if you don't mind a quick followup, I guess the question I'm asking is, is above-trend growth itself a problem? CHAIR POWELL. It's only a problem in so -- it's not, itself, a problem. It's only a problem insofar as it makes it more difficult for us to achieve our goals. And, you know, if you have growth that's robust what that will mean is probably we'll keep the labor market very strong. It probably will place some upward pressure on inflation.

How do you interpret the state of the labor market right now, and in particular, you've referred even today to evidence that it's coming into better balance. What would you need to see to conclude that it has reached that balance? CHAIR POWELL. So on the better balance side, there's just a lot of things. You see job growth still strong but moving back down to more sustainable levels given population growth and labor force participation. The things that are not quite -- but let me go on with that list. You know, claims are low. If you look at surveys of businesses, they're sort of the era of this frantic labor shortage are behind us, and they're seeing a shortage of labor as being significantly alleviated. If you look at shortages of workers, whereas they thought job availability was the highest that it'd ever been or close to it. That's now down to more normal levels by so many measures. Participation, unemployment. So many measures, the unemployment -- job openings, quits, all of those things. So wages are still running a bit above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over a long period of time. They've been gradually cooling off, but if wages are running around 4 percent, that's still a bit above, I would say. And I guess there are just a couple of other -- the unemployment rate is very, very low. And these are -- but I would just say overall the development of the labor market has been very positive. It's been a good time for workers to find jobs and get solid wage increases. MICHELLE SMITH. Claire.\n",

Prices of some goods and services are coming down, but overall, in the aggregate, the price level is not going to -- so people are still living with high prices, and that's not -- that is something that people don't like. And, you know, what will happen with that is wages are now, real wages are now positive, so that wages are now moving up more than inflation as inflation comes down, and so, that might help improve the mood of people. But we do see those, we see those public opinion surveys. The thing that we can do is to do our jobs, which is to use our tools to foster price stability, which has such great benefits over such long periods of time and which is the thing that really enables us to work for and achieve an extended period of high employment, which is so beneficial for, you know, families and companies around the country.\n",

Mr. Chairman, you were, by your own admission, behind the curve in starting to raise rates to fight inflation, and you said earlier, again, the full effects of our tightening cycle have not yet been felt. How will you decide when to cut rates, and how will you ensure you're not behind the curve there? CHAIR POWELL. So we're aware of the risk that we would hang on too long.

Someone once said that you know the natural rate of interest by its works, and that's really right, but that's very difficult because policy operates with a lag.

You said back in July that you needed to start cutting rates before getting to 2 percent inflation. As you mentioned, PCE inflation is now running at 3.5 on core. On a six-month annual basis, core PCE is running at 2.5 percent. Though, when you look at supercore and shelter, they are, of course, stickier. So when looking in the different components of the data, how much closer do you have to get to 2 percent before you consider cutting rates? CHAIR POWELL. I mean, the reason you wouldn't wait to get to 2 percent to cut rates is that policy would be, it would be too late. I mean you'd want to be reducing restriction on the economy well before 2 percent because -- or before you get to 2 percent so you don't overshoot, if we think of restrictive policy as weighing on economic activity. You know, it takes a while for policy to get into the economy, affect economic activity, and affect inflation. So I can't give you a precise answer. But if you look at what's in the SEP, and you know, I think you'll see a reasonable estimate of the time lags and things like that that it would take. JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.

Over the past couple of years a lot of central bankers have talked about the more difficult last mile of getting inflation back down to 2 percent, yet it's also been surprising how fast inflation has come down this year. I'm curious, do you think something has changed in our understanding of inflation, or do you subscribe to this notion still. Or is it something different about the U.S. economy? CHAIR POWELL. I think this. You know, we felt since the beginning that it would be a combination of two factors. The first factor is just the unwinding of what happened in the pandemic, the distortions of supply and demand, and the second thing would be our policy, which was weighing on aggregate demand and actually making it easier for the supply side to recover because of lower demand. We thought those two things were going to be necessary. Sorry, say the last part of your question again. JEAN YUNG. If there was something different about the U.S. economy. CHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So it's not the -- it may or may not be about different, the U.S. economy being different. I think that this inflation was not the classic demand overload, pot boiling over kind of inflation that we think about. It was a combination of very strong demand, without question, and unusual supply side restriction, both on the goods side but also on the labor side, because we had a participation shock. So this is just very unusual, and you know, we had the view. My colleagues and I broadly had the view that we could get a lot of, you know, you had essentially a vertical supply curve because you ran into the limits of capacity at very low levels because there weren't workers and because people couldn't, the supply chains were all broken.

Immigration could help, but it may be that at some point you will run out of supply side help, and then, it gets down to demand, and it gets harder. That's very possible. But to say with certainty that the last mile is going to be different, I'd be reluctant to, you know, to suggest that we have any certainty around that. We just don't know. I mean inflation keeps coming down. The labor market keeps getting back into balance. And it's so far so good, although we kind of assume that it will get harder from here, but so far it hasn't.\n",

Small banks, especially community banks, have a deep understanding of the local economies they serve, and can respond quickly and effectively to local needs. Indeed, financial inclusion is a core mission of community banks; but no entity or group of financial institutions alone can solve the challenge of creating a more inclusive financial system. Today, I will discuss my views on why financial inclusion is important to all of usâfrom community banks to central banks. I will then highlight activities in which the Federal Reserve participates to promote financial inclusion and conclude with ideas for future work and collaboration.\n",

      "An inclusive financial system offers access and choices that enhance consumers' and businesses' financial well-being. From checking and savings accounts to credit and insurance, consumers benefit from having financial products and services that are affordable, safe, and responsive to their needs. Without them, consumers may turn to alternative financial services, which can often be more costly or may lead to consumer harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "An inclusive financial system recognizes that consumers come from a wide range of economic circumstances; have varied perceptions of and experiences with the banking system; and most importantly, different needs for financial products and services. And despite the general availability of online financial services, geography, location, and accessibility matter. Financial inclusion may look very different, for instance, in rural communities, compared to the suburbs of Washington, D.C., or the islands of Hawaii. The entire economy gains when more households achieve financial stability. That said, the benefits of financial inclusion do not necessarily result in the same outcomes for everyone.\n",

      "The road to fostering a more inclusive financial system is long and winding and may, at times, seem daunting. We have been on this road for some time, and the Federal Reserve and many others have already taken many promising steps. So, I'd like to share a few examples of the Fed's recent efforts to promote financial inclusion that will help to provide some context to our ongoing efforts.\n",

      "Supporting access to responsive products: small-dollar lending\n",
      "For many years, a variety of surveys have indicated that consumers use small-dollar credit to address temporary cash-flow imbalances, unexpected expenses, or income shortfalls during periods of economic stress or natural disasters. So, we began to consider the ways in which the Federal Reserve and other financial regulators could be helpful. Shortly after I joined the Federal Reserve, in 2019 and through 2020, we issued two interagency statements meant to provide clarity to banks on the use of alternative data for underwriting and on principles for offering responsible small-dollar loans.3 Our guidance clarified that with a consumer's permission, banks can use alternative data, like checking account balance activity, to qualify them for credit. Our guidance also underscored that small-dollar lending products that support successful repayment outcomes and that avoid continuous cycles of debt due to rollover and reborrowing can help facilitate financial inclusion. We have seen some evidence that suggests the release of these small-dollar Interagency Lending Principles correlated with a subsequent increase in bank consumer lending.4 Ensuring that small-dollar lending is available through depository institutions rather than through other non-depository lenders could increase the credit opportunities available to consumers at lower cost and with fewer fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "Banks may also pursue expanding their lending opportunities through technology innovations that provide mechanisms for more effective risk modelling or enhancing their online access to financial services for consumers. These advancements can result in faster loan decisionmaking, more convenient customer access, and reduced costs and risks for both banks and borrowers. Over time, we are seeing more banks incorporating these approaches to better serve clients with credit, including the use of alternative data to support underwriting. We will continue to monitor these promising developments to better understand the impact on consumers.\n",

      "Supporting mission-driven organizations \n",
      "I will turn now to the Fed's efforts to build the institutional capacity of a set of key stakeholders: Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), Women-Owned Depository Institutions (WDIs), and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), whose missions are to reach historically underserved populations. Providing support for these institutions is an important part of the Federal Reserve's mission to provide a safe, sound, and accessible banking system that protects consumers.5\n",

      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "Through the Fed's Partnership for Progress (PFP) program, we provide technical assistance on regulatory matters, conduct research, host convenings, and provide examiner training to support and promote the stability of MDIs and WDIs.6 Research suggests that MDIs are more likely to focus their products and services to benefit diverse communities and to work with more consumers who experience credit constraints in comparison with non-MDIs.7 The extent of their reach was evident during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, when they demonstrated effective contributions to the economic resiliency of their communities.8 During the pandemic, MDIs and CDFIs provided Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans to small businesses and financially underserved firms.9 The Fed supported these important financial service providers by providing liquidity through its emergency lending program, the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility.10\n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "The Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) provided additional support to MDIs and CDFIs. Through the ECIP, MDIs and CDFIs received over $8.5 billion in low-cost capital to support the provision of loans and grants to small businesses and consumers in their communities. The Federal Reserve conducted collective webinars and individualized outreach to MDIs to encourage enrollment in the program. Our early internal analysis shows, on average, that eligible banks are using ECIP to strengthen balance sheets, build internal capacity, and enhance product offerings. As a result, we have seen ECIP recipients increase their lending about a year after receiving funds, relative to MDIs and CDFIs that did not receive ECIP funding.\n",

This group brings together the central banks of the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia with the purpose of understanding and researching related economic and financial issues, knowledge sharing, and financial education targeted to these communities.11 As the Federal Reserve's network representative, I recently participated in the CBNII's biennial symposium focused on the importance of Indigenous financial inclusion.12 My remarks there reiterated the view that a financial system must be inclusive for the economy to work for everyone and must include access for Indigenous communities.\n",

      "Chairman Hill, Ranking Member Lynch, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss supervision and regulation as it relates to innovation in the financial system.\n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "The Federal Reserve is committed to supporting responsible innovation, both by the firms we oversee directly, and in the financial system broadly. We recognize that innovation can reinforce the safety and soundness of banks and the stability of our financial system, increase operational efficiencies, and reduce costs. Innovation can increase opportunities for financial inclusion and pave the way for new financial products and services that benefit the public.\n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "However, innovation can also lead to risks, some of which are familiar and others more novel. The Federal Reserve Board, alongside the other federal bank regulatory agencies, has a statutory responsibility to supervise banks to help ensure they operate in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with all applicable laws. In keeping with that mission, we require the banks we oversee to identify and manage the risks associated with the new technologies they use.\n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "Our approach to supervising and regulating innovation in banking is based on the following overarching principles. First, activities that present fundamentally the same risks should be regulated in the same way, regardless of where or how the activity occurs or the terms used to describe the activity. If, in other words, a novel product or service raises the same risks as a traditional activity, it should be subject to the same regulation, even if it is based on new technology or described using different terminology.\n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the Federal Reserve has not taken and does not take a position on who banks can offer services to, so long as they remain within the confines of the law. Banking organizations are neither prohibited nor discouraged from providing banking services to customers of any specific class or type, as permitted by law or regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, we have sought to be transparent about our expectations and approaches to novel activity supervision and regulation to provide a pathway for responsible innovation. We articulate those expectations through a variety of channels, including guidance, statements, and other resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we recognize that we also must continue to learn, which is why we engage in regular outreach. Federal Reserve staff frequently meets with banks, nonbank fintechs, academics, and others to exchange views on how technology is changing the banking sector and the financial system as a whole. These meetings provide an important window into how innovation is shaping the banking sector and are vital to helping us develop appropriate supervisory and policy actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "In keeping with these principles, the Federal Reserve recently announced the creation of a novel activities supervision program to focus on the supervision of risks posed by novel, technology-driven activities at banks.1 These activities include those involving crypto-assets, distributed ledger technology, and complex technology-driven bank partnerships with nonbank fintechs. We expect this program to evolve as new technologies emerge. By dedicating a team of supervisory experts to the oversight of novel, technology-driven activities, our aim is to provide clarity as well as timely, consistent, and relevant feedback to the institutions we supervise. We want banks to continue to take advantage of innovations, while also operating in a safe and sound manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "As I noted previously, distributed ledger technology and crypto-asset-related activities are a focus of the novel activities supervision program. Distributed ledger technology offers the potential to increase efficiencies, lower costs, and increase access to financial products and services. Crypto-assets leverage the technology and are generally issued on open, public, decentralized networks. Both crypto-assets and the technology underlying them also present risks, including those related to governance and risk management of the network, and legal uncertainties around issues such as settlement finality and ownership rights. And crypto-assets' pseudonymous nature can create heightened illicit finance risks. As with all of their activities, banks engaging with the crypto-asset sector are expected to do so in a manner that is safe and sound. For example, banks with a high concentration in crypto-asset-related deposits may face heightened liquidity risks, given the significant volatility and interconnectedness in the sector, and should appropriately manage such risk.2\n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond crypto-assets, some banks have expressed interest in more directly engaging in distributed ledger technology and tokenization of traditional assets, such as currency or securities, to expedite and automate payment, clearing, and settlement services.\n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "Digital tokens that aim to maintain a stable value relative to a government-issued currencyâoften referred to as \"stablecoins\" or \"dollar tokens\"âhave rightly garnered significant attention, given their implications for payments and financial stability. To provide clarity for banks interested in engaging with dollar tokens, we recently issued guidance on the process by which a Federal Reserve-supervised bank can seek to obtain a supervisory non-objection before issuing, holding, or transacting in dollar tokens.3 This process will allow the Federal Reserve to verify that a bank has appropriate risk management systems in place to identify and control potential risks with respect to dollar tokens, including those related to operations, cybersecurity, liquidity, illicit finance, and consumer compliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "Novel banking activities involving complex partnerships between banks and technology-intensive third parties have also been an important area of focus. Third-party relationships can offer banks, particularly community banks, access to new technologies and innovation but can also introduce risks that need to be managed, such as, for example, operational risks and consumer compliance risks. As I mentioned, the novel activities supervision program will be helping to oversee complex technology-driven bank partnerships with nonbank financial technology companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "The federal bank regulatory agencies have also recently issued guidance on third-party risk management, which lays out the agencies' supervisory expectations for all types of third-party relationships, including relationships with financial technology companies.4 In addition, the agencies have released a guide designed to assist community banks to assess risks in constructing and considering relationships with fintech companies.5\n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "Another technology that holds potential is artificial intelligence (AI). Banks are leveraging AI for a variety of applications, such as fraud monitoring and customer service. While the technology offers several benefits, it also poses risks, including data challenges, explainability, bias, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. Given these risks, it is important that banks using AI are doing so in a safe, sound, and compliant manner. Federal Reserve staff continues to work closely with the other federal bank regulatory agencies to track and learn more about emerging practices regarding banks' use of AI and related risk management.\n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, it is important to note that innovation is not confined to the private sector. The Federal Reserve is focused on finding opportunities to use innovative technology to enhance our supervision of the banking industry. We are evaluating industry-leading technology to determine if adoption of such tools will enhance our supervision technology and increase efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "[SECTION]\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "The Federal Reserve is committed to supporting responsible innovation so that the financial system and the public can enjoy the many benefits innovation can offer. At the same time, we are mindful of our mission to keep the financial system safe and sound and so are focused on ensuring that any risks associated with novel financial products and services are properly managed.\n",

      "Now, the concerns that have been expressed relate to the possibility that the Fed's highly expansionary policies might be contributing to inflation risk. I would simply point to the record. If you look back for the last five years, inflation--although it's been volatile because of commodity price fluctuations--has averaged about 2 percent, which is close to a reasonable definition of price stability, whereas the area where we have fallen short, obviously, is on the unemployment side. So I think that criticisms based on the concern about inflation have so far, at least, not proved to be very valid.ding about Fed policy, in your opinion? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, politics is politics, and the Federal Reserve tries to stay nonpartisan and out of those debates. I mean, our job is to do the best we can for the U.S. economy, to do what we can to promote our mandate of maximum employment and price stability, and although we must be accountable to the Congress over the longer term, in the short term, it's very important that the Fed be free from political pressures. And therefore, we are going to make our decisions based on what's good for the economy, and we're not going to take any politics into account.s. Consequently, this maturity extension program should foster more accommodative financial conditions, thereby helping support a stronger recovery without changing the overall size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. In addition, to further ease conditions in mortgage markets, we are continuing our previously announced program in which the principal payments from our holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities are being reinvested in agency MBS. The Committee regularly reviews the size and composition of our securities holdings, and we are prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.\n",

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Has the Fed discussed the idea of nominal GDP targeting? And what are your views on the advantages and disadvantages of that approach? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. So the Fed's mandate is, of course, a dual mandate. We have a mandate for both employment and for price stability, and we have a framework in place that allows us to communicate and to think about the two sides of that mandate. We talked today--or yesterday, actually--about nominal GDP as an indicator, as an information variable, as something to add to the list of variables that we think about, and it was a very interesting discussion. However, we think that within the existing framework that we have, which looks at both sides of the mandate, not just some combination of the two, we can communicate whatever we need to communicate about future monetary policy.

For example, as you know, two of the largest holders of U.S. Treasury securities are China and Japan, who hold those securities primarily as foreign exchange reserves and, in the case of China, in an effort to keep their exchange rate from appreciating too quickly. So, I was--while it's good that foreign central banks and so on have the confidence to buy U.S. Treasuries, it's not quite the same as investing in plant and equipment. We've seen a little bit of improvement there, but it's still obviously too low to be consistent with a full employment economy.\n",

For example, the composition of their capital is not, as far as I understand, purely common equity. I do not know what risk weights are being applied to the assets. So there are a number of questions of comparability. My expectation and hope is that--over the medium term, that the Europeans who agreed to the Basel III conditions will ensure that their banks meet the Basel III standards over time.

After picking up somewhat over the summer, activity in the housing sector has flattened out and remains well below the levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants revised up their assessments of GDP growth this year but expect growth to cool, with the median projection falling to 1.4 percent next year.The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into better balance. Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 204 thousand jobs per month, a strong pace that is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year. The unemployment rate remains low, at 3.7 percent. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers: The labor force participation rate has moved up since last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has returned to pre-pandemic levels. Nominal wage growth appears to be easing, and job vacancies have declined. Although the jobsto-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressures on inflation. The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises somewhat from 3.8 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent at the end of next year.Inflation has eased over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Based on the Consumer Price Index and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in November; and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.1 percent. The lower inflation readings over the past several months are welcome, but we will need to see further evidence to build confidence that inflation\fDecember 13, 2023Chair Powell's Press Conference\n",

Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. As is evident from the SEP, we anticipate that the process of getting inflation all the way to 2 percent will take some time. The median projection in the SEP is 2.8 percent this year, falls to 2.4 percent next year, and reaches 2 percent in 2026.The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5-1/4 percentage points, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than $1 trillion. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. The Committee decided at today's meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.While we believe that our policy rate is likely at or near its peak for this tightening cycle, the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured. We are prepared to tighten policy further if appropriate. We are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently\fDecember 13, 2023Chair Powell's Press Conference\n",

While participants do not view it as likely to be appropriate to raise interest rates further, neither do they want to take the possibility off the table. If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.6 percent at the end of 2024, 3.6 percent at the end of 2025, and 2.9 percent at the end of 2026, still above the median longer-term rate. These projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum employment and price stability goals.In light of the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the Committee is proceeding carefully. We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks. In determining the extent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.

So that's -- when you get to that question, and that's your answer, there's a natural -- naturally it begins to be the next question, which is when it will become appropriate to begin dialing back the amount of policy restraint that's in place. So that's really the next question, and that's what people are thinking about and talking about. And I would just say this, we are seeing, you know, strong growth that appears to be moderating, We're seeing a labor market that is coming back into balance by so many measures, and we're seeing inflation making real progress. These are the things we've been wanting to see. We can't know -- we still have a ways to go. No one is declaring victory. That would be premature, and we can't be guaranteed of this progress. So, we're moving carefully in making that assessment of whether we need to do more or not. And that's really the question that we're on, but of course, the other question, the question of when will it become appropriate to begin dialing back the amount of policy restraint in place, that begins to come into view, and is clearly a topic of discussion out in the world and also a discussion for us at our meeting today.\n",

      "not matched:  PRELIMINARYforecasters predicted very weak growth or a recession. Not only did that not happen, we actually had a very strong year, and that was a combination of strong demand but also real gains on the supply side. So this was the year when labor force participation picked up, where immigration picked up, where the distortions to supply and demand from the pandemic, you know, the shortages and the bottlenecks, really began to unwind. So we had significant supply side gains with strong demand, and we got what looks like a two and half percent plus or a little more than that growth year at a time when potential growth this year might even have been higher than that, just because of the healing on the supply side. So that was a surprise to just about everybody. I think the inflation forecast is roughly what people wrote down a year ago but in a very different setting, and I would say the labor market because of the stronger growth has also been significantly better. If you look back at the SEP from a year ago, there was a significant increase in unemployment. It didn't really happen. We're still at 3.7 percent. So we've seen, you know, strong growth, still a tight labor market, but one that's coming back into balance with the -- with support from the supply side, a greater supply of labor. It's a -- you know, that's what we see, and I think that combination was not anticipated broadly.\n",

So I think we'll be very much keeping that in mind as we make policy going forward. And the things we'll be looking at, I've already described. You know, we're obviously looking hard at what's happening with demand, and what we see, we see the same thing other people see, which is a strong economy, which really put up quite a performance in 2023. We see good evidence and good reason to believe that growth will come in lower next year. And you see what the forecasts are. I think the median participant wrote down 1.4 percent growth, but you know, we'll have to see. It's very hard to predict. We'll also be looking to see progress on inflation, and you know, the labor market remaining strong, but ideally without seeing the kind of large increase in unemployment that happens sometimes.\n",

The question is, you know, once that part of it runs out, and we think it has a ways to run. We definitely think that the sort of supply chain and shortages side has some ways to run. Does labor force participation has much more to run? It might. Immigration could help, but it may be that at some point you will run out of supply side help, and then, it gets down to demand, and it gets harder. That's very possible. But to say with certainty that the last mile is going to be different, I'd be reluctant to, you know, to suggest that we have any certainty around that. We just don't know.

There was a certain amount of pressure that emerged almost automatically out of the process just by our sticking to our nonborrowed path when the banks were demanding additional reserves. That automatically imposed some increased need for borrowing. And then a further downward adjustment was made in the nonborrowed path to increase the degree of pressure, and at about the same time the discount rate was raised. So by forcing the banks to borrow--I think it was around $1.8 billion--at an even higher discount rate, we put still greater upward pressure [on rates]. What we got, as I described, was a very substantial move in short-term rates of 3 or 4 percentage points over a few weeks. And I think it got some banks feeling that they were staring very hard at the possibility of a crunch and the prospect of just not being able to fund themselves. So in that sense the program is working; it has [produced] very real restraint for the banking system. I don't know that bigger moves or earlier moves in the discount rate would have done anything more than was being done [through our operations]. I don't know that we should have [done] more because I think we were imposing quite a bit of restraint.\n",

What was actually done was to have a small rise in the discount rate and a reduction in the nonborrowed path, which was somewhere in between all those alternatives. by nonborrowed reserves and what part is borrowed. What really matters for determining the money supply is the amount of reserves, the total base out there to support money in some multiplier sense. And over a long enough period, it can't really matter whether that's through nonborrowed reserves or borrowed reserves. In the very short run because of this mix, with required reserves fixed, it does matter because it affects the behavior of the funds rate given the discount rate. But if we put in a high discount rate, then for any given total reserves we would have less borrowed reserves and more nonborrowed. If our estimate of the discount rate is low, we'd have the reverse situation. So, while we could do that, we would simply be changing the mix between nonborrowed and borrowed reserves for any given level of total reserves that would support the money supply. I don't think that would be very helpful to you; we would be glad to do it, of course.

There was very fine work on that. Yet the net outcome was that total reserves got out of hand on the up side for a while.

      "MR. AXILROD. Well, our views are probably marginally different. A difference is that I might allege that we could hit the total reserve path week to week. I don't think it's very important to do it, but we could without lagged reserve accounting. But we'd have to have very large movements in the federal funds rate because we'd have to force the banks, within the statement week, to adjust their deposits to the total reserves we'd put out there. We'd have to force them to do it. Without lagged reserve accounting that is possible. With lagged reserve accounting, that could also occur. If we allow enough pressure on the funds rate, they could make the adjustments in deposits but we just won't see it in total reserves until two weeks later. So within a very short-run period it would look as if we were missing our total reserves; but actually we'd be getting adjustments in deposits that would be [evident] in required reserves two weeks later and we'd really not be off very badly. We would just be over path for a while and then we'd be back on path. That's the essence of what Mr. Sternlight is saying and I wouldn't quarrel with that particular statement. Indeed, the money supply is coming back on target now, or seemingly so, if March turns out as we are projecting it. There has been a rapid response to the rise in the funds rate that has occurred, just as happened in October, which may be a coincidence or it may be that the lags [in response to changes in] the funds rate are not six months [but are closer to] one day. It's hard to believe the latter but something like that has happened for two successive periods. I am not sure whether I have answered the question, but I think I at least came close to it.\n",

And he's not going to have any alternative but to chase those borrowings down and put in more nonborrowed. Because of the volatility of deposits week to week, I think we'd be certain to get more fluctuations in the federal funds rate. However, with the system we're now operating on, where he knows required reserves and we make adjustments on an average path for a four-week period, we make those adjustments so that we [take into account] the required reserve pattern that we know for certain over the two weeks ahead. And we tend to make the borrowings the same in each of those weeks. So we let nonborrowed reserves vary with the deposits while tending to hold the borrowing stable in an average path for a four-week period.

We were trying to get some materials before the Committee at this meeting. Whether we can do so at the next meeting or if it will be after that I am not certain, in view of what is going on.

From that point on, I have had the impression that activity has been curtailed in those GNMA futures.

That's because we could adjust the borrowings, presumably, to achieve the same result. The reason the discount rate was not moved--let's be clear about it--is that we were waiting for this program, and it seemed inappropriate to raise the discount rate when the Administration was trying to negotiate these pending changes. The judgment was either right or wrong; but it was a judgment we made.

But that gives us a high April figure because from February to the end of March M1 will have increased 12 percent, roughly, and that gets into the April figure. I wouldn't doubt, given our GNP projections, that we're going to have a second-quarter rate of growth close to what we've estimated here on average, something like 4-3/4 percent. Whether it's going to come with a large April or a large May or a large June, or whether it will be an even distribution among those months, I really can't be very certain.

If people put the funds into demand accounts, we wouldn't expect them to stay there long. Why would people want to hold more demand deposits? So, they would either transfer the funds to another asset, such as a money market fund or a T-bill or something, or start spending them.

Reading back, in recent years they were, in billions of dollars, 36, 34, 31, and 29. So you can see that it's a quantum jump this year on the order of $12 billion. In March of the previous four years the refunds were around $9-1/2 to $10 billion; this year they will be around $13.7 billion, according to these estimates.

And it seems to me the counterpart of this is that we may go into a recession [with] an awful lot of strains that are likely to lead to a deeper recession. One sector in particular that is showing great strains even in a forward moving economy is the savings banks; the situation in New England is getting critical. I was a little shocked yesterday to find out that they may be in a position to have ordinary access to the discount window within as little as two weeks. If that's the case, we have an awful lot of issues to resolve. As you know, in the past we have not loaned to organizations that were clearly insolvent.

      "-23-8/80IS. It's true of banks, too, but it's much more the case with the savings banks, particularly in New England where the average yield on their portfolios is very much lower than on the West Coast. That's because (a) we've been a slow growing region; and (b) New Englanders don't change their houses as frequently as people in California do. That has led to a very old and very low yielding portfolio. So, not only do they have liquidity problems but they have very serious earnings problems. Most of the savings banks in New England will probably show a deficit in earnings this year. There are other complications. There is this new dual rate which was set up to deal with large commercial banks. I think that is perfectly fine, in light of the fact that that's where the growth of credit has been most pronounced. But some of the most seriously troubled savings banks in New England have assets in excess of $500 million. And the question is: Do we want to charge them the premium rate?

      "We also have in our area the same grave concerns that Frank has in Massachusetts and New England generally. Our thrifts are in very bad shape. Three of the ten largest mutual savings banks in New York were in the red for 1979, and probably more will be in the red for 1980. It is disintermediation on the one side and terrible earnings on the other side. My own feeling is that if the consumer hadn't been running out of gas before last Friday, he certainly has had his accelerator taken away from him as of Friday. On the other hand, though, we're hearing that some companies are accelerating the timing of their annual wage increases. For example, if an annual review was to be in July or August, they're bringing it forward. So the consumer may have a little extra money in his pocket. The Board staff's projections of the outlook for the next 15 months seem pretty reasonable. In all the circumstances, my thought is that we should hang in there, which is probably what \"B\" does. That would be my idea of hanging in there. retire. We have the impression that inventories are generally modest, although for some small retailers they are pretty minimal. I have the impression that in New York City retail sales are pretty good, but that may not be the case outside of the city. We've had some indications that in the first two months of the year there have been price increases, particularly by the large grocery chains. Some people explain that as the reason for all the coupons we're getting in our Sunday newspapers. In effect, it's giving back the anticipatory price increase.\n",

      "In terms of policy, it seems to me that we've got to get the monetary aggregates under control. February was perhaps a one-month aberration, but there was a run-up in the aggregates. That, together with negative market reaction to the President's program, is really going to fuel inflationary expectations. Indeed, as has been remarked here, with energy costs increasing in the short term we could have an increase in inflation. That is bound to cause consumers to lack confidence in what has been done by the Administration, and we could have an increase in inflationary expectations with the obvious results. So my judgment, Mr. Chairman, which is a little different from the staff's at the Atlanta Bank, is to err on the side of greater restraint. While alternative B seems to me a viable alternative, whereas I would not consider alternative A to be viable, my preference would be to go for something along the lines of alternative C to demonstrate in the near term to the markets that we're going to continue with this program of restraint.t than in other parts of the country. But the perception of the future is that we're in for a very difficult time. Our business people and directors see automobile dealers, farmers, small business people, and thrifts being hurt pretty badly and I think there is a real fear at this point of a credit crunch coming along. While I don't have any data, and my staff hasn't given me any data about small banks, I have an intuitive feeling that some of the small banks in the District are probably in much the same condition as savings and loans, although perhaps not to the same degree. My personal feeling, after hearing all of this from people around the District, is that the pessimism is perhaps a little overdone. Recession, in my judgment, would not be all that bad if we are going to get prices under control.\n",

      "precious few signs of any present or impending recession, particularly as our directors view [the situation]. With the obvious exception of housing and autos, things seem to be moving along at a very rapid rate. There is continued strength in consumer spending; it's almost hard to believe. I believe much of that still reflects a \"buy it now before it gets more expensive\" approach. Labor demand in defenserelated industries and high technology industries such as electronics and aerospace is contributing to continued strength in employment in the District. Loan demand remains strong at banks and, despite the recent flooding in California, agriculture all around the West seems to be in pretty good shape. I think the difference between West of the Rockies and what Mark was reporting probably stems from the predominance of large branch systems around the West. I know that in California our three largest banks are among the three largest agricultural lenders anywhere in the country. And, of course, a good part of that lending is to agri-business, but they take reasonably good care of the smaller farmers as well--to the extent that we have some of those around the West, and we do. Demand for lumber you'd think would be falling out of bed because of housing, and yet exports to the Pacific Basin area have made up a good part of that. So, in short, while this may not be applicable to the national scene, our directors just don't see any signs of recession in our part of the country nor do they believe one is ahead for the regional economy.

We recently had the first of the ABA/FRB seminars, which originally was supposed to cover the subject of regulation under that plan that you encouraged us to get into. We had, I thought, a very good meeting. We had a number of people from the Board as principal speakers, some of the division directors and also Governor Wallich as a principal speaker on monetary policy. We got quite a bit of flak as I remember, Henry. There was quite a bit of skepticism expressed in that audience about whether we were going to stick to our announced target of ongoing restraint because of what those February numbers were showing--and they were aware of them by then--on the money supply. Another month like that would really undermine our credibility a great deal, so I share Willis' view about doing something about the April bulge if we can. And I think we probably should.

It seems to me that credibility of the Federal Reserve System may be the more important aspect, at least of near-term policy. The potential bulge in April is part of the problem. I'd hate to go back to the [procedures used] prior to October 6 and focus on interest rates. But I think it's extremely important--for international and domestic reasons, inflationary anticipation, and other things--that we not permit [the funds] rate to come down very far in the next month or two. As a result, \"B\" looks very reasonable to me. I would be inclined to move a little closer to \"C\" because of the potential for interest rate movements if indeed the demand for money begins to ease somewhat because of the lower projection of growth. And as I understand it, the restraint program may depress that another half percent over the year. How that will roll into the [next] two months, I don't know. So, \"B\" would be reasonable and I would be inclined to move a little toward \"C\" if that were the sense of the Committee. I would also set the federal funds range by raising the lower end and reestablishing the 4 percent spread, thus coming out with a 14 to 18 percent range with the anticipation that interest rates would remain in the upper half of that range for at least the next 60 days.\n",

It restricts our image of flexibility when it gets published. Instead, I would just go to the 20 percent on the up side and be done with it, recognizing that that would give us cover for an interim period, rather than have to go back frequently to jiggle it up another half or one percentage point. I don't see any objection to going to the 20 percent, given the rate structure we have today. before this forthcoming recession is over.

On the other hand, if we choose alternative C, we will have a lower rate of increase in the second quarter and a higher rate of increase in the third and fourth quarters.

As I look back over our record, I am impressed that we never stopped fighting recession. We moved imperceptibly from fighting the last recession and its consequences into worrying about the next recession.

That is, I lean toward \"C.\" The market has not been impressed by our policy package except abroad. The bond market hasn't responded very much. Short-term rates are actually down. I think there is a real danger that if we now give the impression that we are about to relax our general credit restraint behind a shield of selective credit controls, we will get the worst of both worlds. We'll get the selective controls not working--I have not been very enthusiastic about them anyway--but we should do what we can not to disavow them completely. That is best done by not throwing any burden on them and by holding to a firm general control. I think it's important at this time not to convey the impression that the regular discount rate, which wasn't changed, is the discount rate and that essentially we have taken evasive action in trying to avoid raising the discount rate.

And this is a means of investing funds at obviously very low rates of return currently for the purpose of getting into real estate, in this instance in fairly modest-size packages. There are a lot of small business firms being sold to foreigners as well, all the way from the family-size motel to the family-size manufacturing firm. That seems to be going on yet at a rapid pace.

      "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Oh, there's no question that we have recorded a high number for February, which has contributed to that result. But we have recorded it. But again, I [wouldn't] worry too much about where this comes out within a range of 1/4 or 1/2 or even 3/4 percentage point on a February-to-June number, since all of those differences are within our normal range of error anyway. That doesn't excite me terribly at this point. Other people may have different shadings but whether we're looking at \"B\" or \"C\" or something in between in the four-month time perspective, I believe it catches the spirit of what a number of people are saying anyway, to say that in the next month or so--certainly before we next meet--we should be leaning toward taking our chances on being certain to be near those numbers in that very short-run period. I am not saying we can guarantee that we will be within those ranges at any expense of interest rates or anything else. But when we're making up the paths and deciding what the level of borrowing should be or whatever, we ought to be resolving doubts and making sure March is as low as projected and April is no greater than projected or that both of them are lower than projected because that's where our principal vulnerability lies--in this two-month period. If April is anywhere near as strong as the New York figures suggest, we'll be above the \"B\" alternative. I feel quite certain that we at least ought to be leaning in the other direction, and reasonably hard, during these next six weeks or so. We don't want to give the market a false signal if the money supply comes in very low for a couple of weeks that we are relaxing too quickly during this immediate time frame, when we've just announced these new programs and there is the kind of feeling in the country that I think exists. There is plenty of time before June to take account of any shortfalls we might have in the money supply if that happy event should occur in the very immediate future. I don't know what the March data are going to show. If March came in under Mr. Axilrod's projections and we were facing--in terms of our seat-ofthe-pants judgment or the pit of our stomach or whatever--the kind of bulge that is projected for April, we ought to be delighted with a low March figure. So, I am suggesting that we lean in that direction. And whether we come out between \"B\" and \"C\" over a four-month perspective concerns me less than [that we take] this posture I have suggested before the next meeting. We could reconcile my longer-term concerns by making it someplace between \"B\" and \"C\" but in the end I could probably tolerate either. But I do feel rather strongly about not giving any false signals in the very short run at the risk of any overkill that might be implied by that.\n",

It doesn't seem likely that growth in March and April will be even, but maybe for the two months it wouldn't be unreasonable to target it that way. Then if March turned negative at minus 1 percent, say, April could be plus 7 percent. That would be an example.

As you know, the budgetary impact there is quite variable; it depends on when the government sells those mortgages. It's an interest [subsidy] that ultimately shows up in the federal expenditures. On the authorizations, that's a difficult question because we have built in a significant increase in defense expenditures along the lines of the Administration's proposals. That could well go higher. A good deal of what the Administration is proposing we have assumed will result in authorizations, but not expenditures, particularly not in the short run. To the extent that the defense sector is geared up more rapidly, there is a bigger increase in actual federal outlays. I think that's conceivable, and it would obviously feed into the real side forecast, particularly in 1981. So, we've assumed a good deal of lag between authorizations and expenditures. I might note that defense ordering has in fact picked up a good deal. And in the fourth quarter, one of the factors--not the main one--leading to a significant increase in federal outlays was a pickup in real defense expenditures.\n",

      "not matched:  MR, FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, we don't have any esoteric tales either to report from the Sixth District. We would generally agree with Jim Kichline's estimate. I think the Southeast pretty much mirrors what is going on in the rest of the country. The economy continues to expand, although there are a few sectors that are showing some signs of slowing. Consumer spending remains pretty strong, although the drought and the unseasonably hot weather affected not only farm prices but consumer spending as well because there were not the usual back-to-school purchases. Industrial employment is continuing to rise. We're looking at some reversals, particularly in the forest industry. [That experienced by] Georgia Pacific, which recently moved to Atlanta, is very much apparent to us in that particular industry. Higher mortgage rates have reduced sales of new homes from the levels that were attained earlier this summer. It seems to me that 13-1/2 to 14 percent rates are about the choke point for most people for new homes as well as existing homes.In the financial sector we've had pretty good deposit and loan growth, although it has been weaker than in June. It's going to be interesting to see what the results of the deregulation move on October 1 will be. I believe that somewhere in the Bluebook or Greenbook there was an indication from the staff that there was not going to be as much hype in advertising for these new instruments as there was before. We don't expect it to be very extensive in Atlanta or in the Southeast, but we do think that it's going to take off to some extent--that there is going to be more advertising and more attempts to draw funds through these instruments into the banks and the S&Ls. Tourism is showing some signs of ebbing particularly in central Florida, and in the Miami area the tourist industry is a disaster. They are doing very badly and that's true not only in Miami Beach and Miami but in Dade County generally.If we had some concerns to express--where we would differ from the staff estimate--it would be on the up side. We think that perhaps there has been some underestimation of the strength of the economy. That is certainly true in our area; we get people talking about this quite a lot in our section of the country. After all, throughout this third-quarter period we did have some strikes, such as the AT&T strike, which I think had an effect on the economy. We had the hurricane in some parts of the country. I think we have to take that into account. So, we would be a little concerned that the thirdquarter number is perhaps on the low side and might be revised upward. There is considerable concern in our District, as I'm sure there is in other Districts, about the [federal budget] deficit, and there's a great deal of concern in the export-related industries about the strength of the dollar. Interestingly, inflation in two of our major cities, Atlanta and Miami, is running about 1.3 to 1.4 percentage point above the national average, so that's a concern. Because of already existing inflation in those cities and the threat of increased food prices as a result of the drought, we see some pressure on prices.One other thing I might mention is related to industrial production and capital expansion. Some of the contacts we've had with industrial development agencies around the District indicate to us that a lot of the capital expansion is being designed to improve existing productivity rather than to meet additional product demand. And finally, Mr. Chairman, there is a good deal of concern in Atlanta\f10/4/83and Miami about the Eastern [Airlines] situation. Governor Martin's remark about concessionary bargaining certainly bears on this. This is a good example of the union leaders not being supported by their own people. I'm not sure they're in the old man/old lady category but the flight attendants, for example, are now coming forward and indicating that perhaps they would rather have wage concessions than have Eastern go under. In other words, they are tending to believe management rather than their own union.\n",

      "\n",
      "not matched:  MR, FORRESTAL. No, the flight attendants are unionized. And they have been mounting a petition in both those cities, Atlanta and Miami, to accept some form of wage concession. They are saying Frank Bowman ought to be believed that the losses are going to be extensive, and it's better to have a 15 percent pay cut than no job. Where the pilots and the others in that company are, I'm not sure. Obviously, the effect of anything happening to Eastern would be devastating in our part of the country because Eastern and Delta account for about 90 percent of all traffic out of Atlanta's airport. So, we're watching that situation pretty carefully.\n",

Mike, the pattern of inventories is pretty critical for the forecast and I think you've made an effective case that we are not going to go through what is considered a drastic inventory cycle. But the thing that strikes me is that, really, this is almost the best of all possible worlds in nonfarm inventories where there is basically no cycle. And I wonder if it's more likely that you would have a greater reaction in terms of production than what you've shown, in which case we might have somewhat weaker growth in the first half.\n",

However, there's one area where I, at least, haven't been able to get very much anecdotal evidence. You mentioned it and I've heard it elsewhere. And that is that some of the accumulation in retail inventories was planned--was desired in effect--to beat higher prices for imports. Could you expound on that?\n",

That is the way it works, and there are lots of ways of cutting this. But, essentially, the slowdown in nominal GNP, which was about 1-1/2 percentage points this year--a little less, 1-1/4--is associated with this kind of interest rate rise on the one hand, and you get the sharp reduction, too, partly because of what Don and his colleagues have been saying for quite a while--because of the considerable interest elasticity in the money numbers.\n",

I would leave the federal funds rate where it is for right now, but I would favor submitting--in the case of our Bank, which would join several others--[a recommendation for] a 1/2 point cut in the discount rate with the hope that the Board would see fit to approve that on Friday. If we had a steady federal funds rate right\f11/5/91-34-now, I think that would be a good way to reassure the long-term markets and it would give us a little more time to judge the easing actions that we took last week. At the same time, reducing the [discount] rate would reestablish a more normal spread between the discount rate and the federal funds rate. And a very important point, to which Governor Angell alluded earlier as did Tom Melzer, is that it might also convince a lot of potential borrowers who are sitting out there just waiting until they think rates have hit the bottom to move into the fray. A lot of people in the real estate business think that is true. Now, if we did adopt that approach, which I'm sure we're not going to, I would favor having an asymmetric directive in favor of ease thereafter.\n",

His dissent was from a directive that he perceived as calling for a more or less automatic tightening of policy during the intermeeting period. On the understanding that any tightening during the intermeeting period would depend on further indications of inflationary developments, Mr. Lindsey requested that his vote be recorded in the minutes as in favor of this policy action.

      "not matched:  MR. TRUMAN.I agree on your firstquestion that I do not have a answer. I will tell you one smallelement of this, however--or give you my position. With respect tothe International Monetary Fund, we are in a somewhat similarposition, though on a slightly different scale, as we are relative tothe Congress. The International Monetary Fund got itself into thissituation essentially in December. They realized that they knew lessabout what was going on in Mexico than we did. We knew a great dealless than we wished we had known, even though we had devoted aconsiderable amount of resources to this on a daily basis for at leastthe last year. What the IMF does know is that Peter Fisher and hiscolleagues as well as people here at the Board have much bettercontacts and information about the day-to-day operations in Mexicothan the Fund has. That is for two reasons: First of all, the Fund,for better or worse, does not have a culture that is designed tofollow day-to-day developments in the individual economies of membernations. Secondly, on the other side, the Mexicans are worldchampions in terms of obfuscating about economic information whilesimultaneously providing a lot of other information. Transparency ofthe way economic policy is conducted in Mexico, including monetarypolicy, is a very serious problem, and it is one that relates to thecomment earlier about the functioning of financial markets as well ascomments--what Governor Lindsey was asking about yesterday--concerningthe balance sheet of the Bank of Mexico from top to bottom.\f1/31-2/1/95-140-To extend Chairman Greenspan's analogy a step further--maybe I am taking it a step back--once we have put the house fire out, we want to build a more fire-proof house and we want to try to encourage the resident of the house to stop smoking or at least to stop smoking in bed. I think we have an interest in getting it done, not that we are going to create a mistake-proof economic environment in Mexico any more than we can create a mistake-proof economic environment in the United States. We can hope that with some effort and a considerable expenditure of Federal Reserve resources--I mean human resources and budgetary resources in one sense--to fix things so that at least we will not have these problems coming back.Let me come back to another point on resources. I share, for all the reasons Governor Blinder has stated, the concerns about what we will monitor and how we will monitor because this will have, among other things, resource implications for the Federal Reserve System. I want to know whether I am going to have to budget one man year or forty-two man years to get this job done right. We need to know at the minimum what we are going to be asked to do, and see whether it is feasible to do it both in terms of resources and, as Governor Lindsey and the Chairman have said, in terms of the intellectual feasibility.\n",

I think we have to focus on whether we should leave the second sentence alone, apart from the minor adjustment that Don Kohn has mentioned, or try to go further. MR. KELLEY. Leave it alone. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The major problem I always have had with this directive has been in the first sentence. I find all the proposed variations of the second sentence to be circumlocutions in one way or another. The difficulty is that we are trying to reflect differing opinions as to how we should view the question of asymmetry. That is an issue we never have been able to resolve among ourselves. There are differences in this Committee and very legitimate differences. Yet, I think we all find a value in maintaining the notion of symmetry and asymmetry, though for somewhat different reasons. There has never been any consensus, as I read the views of this Committee, to eliminate that concept. So, my inclination at this stage, given my suspicion of what would happen if we tried to resolve something that we have failed to do in the past for good reasons--\f8/19/97\n",

      "not matched:  SPEAKER(?). That's right. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley. MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support your recommendation. Relative to the discussion about a possible announcement, I would have a very strong preference for not making one today. That preference is based on a longer-term reason and an immediate reason. The longer-term reason would be the one that has been expressed around the table, namely, that this would have a precedential impact and one that we should consider carefully, not just rush into. I will say parenthetically--we are not going to debate that issue today--that I have very great reservations about the whole idea. More immediately, I believe that if we were to make a new type of announcement today that the market has not seen before and does not expect, it would come as quite a shock and be very confusing. Why are they doing this? Why did they make this announcement and not change policy? I can see the potential for a reaction of fairly major proportions that would not be at all what we are setting out to do. So, I would be very hesitant about that.\f3/31/98\n",

      "not matched:  MR. JORDAN.saidthat every day people ask him to find them a deal so they can put their money to work. But forbalance,who says that everybody already has as much money as theyneed so that the bank cannot find any more borrowers because there are too many lenders. Heconstantly argues that we should lower interest rates so the business firms will be more willing toborrow and produce more to catch up with demand; otherwise, we are going to have inflation.[Laughter] This leads me to be concerned about how directors are selected. [Laughter]A theme among other bankers around the District is that lending is being driven byasset assessments and not at all by cash flows or concerns about future cash flows. Bankerscomplain a lot that pension funds and insurance companies are doing deals that no sensible bankerwould be willing to consider. They indicate that income properties such as hotels, motels, stripmall outlets, all kinds of outlet stores, restaurants, and auto parts stores are having problems. Theturnover in such existing income properties is occurring at prices that these bankers see asquestionable. In Zanesville, Ohio, for instance, they reported that three of the five new auto partsstores that were built last year already were closed in the first quarter of this year. I guess thecapitalist system is working in a certain sense. Losses are being incurred.Another frequent complaint has been the Federal Farm Credit Banks. One bankersaid he lost 15 percent of his ag portfolio in the first quarter of this year alone to the Federal FarmCredit Banks. That caused another banker to say that they decided to get completely out of aglending because they could not compete on equal terms with the Federal Farm Credit Banks.One banker asserted that when he talks to customers about borrowing more, they areunwilling to consider the possibility of a rise in interest rates in the future. They believe that theeconomy is in a permanently low interest rate environment. To his frustration, when he tells them\f5/19/98that they have to allow for the possibility that interest rates could go up, they just dismiss thethought as being unrealistic because the economy has entered a new era. So, he argues that even avery small interest rate increase would have a significant sobering effect on acquisition prices thatare being paid. Another banker commented that all of his customers are bankrupt; they just will notknow it until interest rates go up.In manufacturing, directors have cited numerous examples of acquisition prices thatthey think are too high. For example,equipment business said that he is seeing acquisition prices worldwide that he thinks are out ofsight. In retailing, Dillard Department Stores bought Mercantile Stores on Monday of this week.When the CEO of Mercantile Stores, who is on my Cleveland board, called me over the weekend,he simply said that heapproved itfor his shareholders. That was the best he could say about the transaction.We heard more reports of sharp price increases in farmlands. One that I thoughtwould be of special interest to Don Kohn is that while we were in Wooster, Ohio, we heard thatover the course of the past year over 50 Amish families have sold raw land and moved to aneighboring county. They told us that farmlands that were going for $2,000 to $2,500 per acre ayear ago are now being sold for over $4,000 an acre.As an example of the tightness of labor markets, one banker said that whenever hesees a customer talking to a teller for more than a minute or two, it turns out that the teller is gettinga job offer. [Laughter]With respect to construction, one director said that this spring he has seen moreannouncements of new projects of every type than he has ever seen in the region before. Thisdirector is an official of a building and construction labor union. The surge in new projects may be\f5/19/98reflective of the mild winter and early spring. In any event he sees announcements of new projects involving water, sewer, transportation and auto plants, hospitals, schools, road construction, and hotels all over the District. In Newark, Ohio, three new hotel projects have been announced by major chains, financed by institutional investors. So, we will have plenty of hotels in Newark.As others have noted, there are numerous reports of health care cost increases. The most extreme that I have heard involves Pennsylvania Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which is requesting a 30 percent increase this year.Turning to the national situation, over 25 years ago Leonid Brezhnev said that the fundamental problem we faced was that we can only distribute and consume what we actually produce, and he felt that a capitalist plot was involved. But we do face that problem. How much demand is out there, what is fostering all of this demand, and what is the probability that we are going to have adequate aggregate supply to keep up with all of it? A year ago, I was hearing reports of good economic conditions, but also about the need to be cautious about taking risks. Now I only hear reports about good economic conditions. People's expectations about returns that are available to them on a variety of investments clearly have risen very sharply, whether it is direct or indirect, in the equity markets, in residential and commercial income properties, and in various types of new business ventures. So, in a relative sense, they view the costs of borrowing funds for investing as having gone down compared to what they can get on more secure long-term financial instruments like Treasuries. I thought that Al Broaddus' initial analysis on this point was correct.We have all become accustomed to repeating the Chairman's way of phrasing the objective of our policy and its success as being inflation that is so low that people do not even think about it. In that sense, we have been meeting that criterion in terms of output prices. But a corollary also has to be that we do not see people making decisions based on the assumption that\f5/19/98asset prices will rise forever relative to output prices. In that sense, we are not meeting the criterion, and we are not being successful. We all know that asset prices cannot rise forever relative to output prices or income streams. So, the good news is that this too will end. The question is how and when. Over the last two years through the first four months of this year, I have seen that not only is demand for output from households and businesses very strong, but it also is continuing to accelerate. I believe such demand is being fostered by excessive growth of money and bank credit and we see a lot of evidence that supports that argument. We need to see that growth in demand slow down. It is not a question to me of no change or a small change in the stance of current monetary policy in terms of the interbank overnight rate. It is a question of a small change now or a much bigger change later on.\n",

      "not matched:  SPEAKER(?). How long is the lease? MR. GUYNN. I'm not sure. [Laughter] CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. As long as they stay! MR. GUYNN. As long as they stay. On the national front, like others, I see an economy that is divided into two very divergent sectors: the international sector, which is looking weaker and weaker, and a strong domestic economy, where growth was paced in the first quarter by robust gains in consumer spending, business investment, and inventory expansion. It\f6/30-7/1/98seems to me that there is little one can do directly with monetary policy to affect the international sector. After taking account of the damping effect it is having on overall domestic real growth, I would argue that we should not allow international developments to divert attention unduly away from any developing imbalances in the domestic economy. Fortunately, I don't believe that is happening, at least not yet. To be sure, consumer spending continues to pace the domestic economy. Last Friday's spending and income numbers continue to suggest that the consumer is not yet spending beyond his means. Consumer debt burdens remain somewhat high, as do bankruptcies, but appear to be manageable so far. Corporate profits remain strong, increasing but at a decreasing rate. Whether this will damp investment and whether the recent buildup in inventories is planned or unanticipated continue to be key questions in my mind.Our forecast for the next two years is similar to that in the Greenbook and to many other forecasts. Like the Greenbook, though with some difference in composition, we see some slowing in coming quarters due primarily to a slackening in investment spending and a pullback in inventory spending. We see consumer expenditures remaining strong. We anticipate that inflationary pressures will be modest over the forecast period, with the expected pickup in inflation being due primarily to an unwinding of the favorable effects that recent declines in energy prices have had on prices rather than a surge in underlying inflationary pressures. To be sure, the risks to this forecast, as others have said, are different depending on whether one looks at the domestic or the international components. Clearly, as Peter Fisher has laid out and others have commented, problems in Japan and elsewhere in Asia could worsen significantly and the ripple effects could be quite alarming. However, I think the risks to the domestic economy remain on the upside. In my view, it would be premature to take down the caution flag in that\f6/30-7/1/98area quite yet. We have continually been surprised by the strength in investment and consumer spending, and those patterns could well continue for some time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n",

      "not matched:  SPEAKER(?). So, it's only 20! MR. GRAMLICH. That's right. Perhaps it's only 20. The adoption of inflation targeting is not as widespread as I said earlier, but it's still widespread. And it has worked well where it has been tried, as documented by a number of research papers. Perhaps more telling, no country that I know of has tried inflation targeting and then abandoned it. What many academics like about inflation targeting is that it gives policy a nominal anchor and improves transparency and credibility. Those are important values. But I'd like to put inflation targeting on our table for a different reason. It seems to me that it would work well when we are facing just the sort of economic uncertainties that I mentioned above. First of all, when there are either productivity or competitive shocks in labor markets and wages just don't seem to be rising in the way forecast, inflation targeting permits us to follow the policy of watchful waiting we often talk about. Just what are we waiting for? It is really to see signs of an acceleration of inflation, in which case we can react by making appropriate policy changes.\f12/21/9936Another uncertainty that inflation targeting permits us to finesse is that of deciding just what our target rate of inflation is. Around the world, most inflation-targeting countries do have fairly specific quantitative targets. I'm not sure that this group could agree on a precise inflation target, but I don't think we have to agree. What I think we can all agree on is that we should move against an acceleration of inflation. In effect, this pragmatic form of inflation targeting, where we move against an acceleration of inflation, may provide us a reasonable framework for thinking about monetary policy in the presence of either productivity or competitive shocks.But even this pragmatic form of inflation targeting has one important difficulty. The big difficulty I see is in acting preemptively, which I think is necessary if we really are to stabilize inflation at present low levels. In order to act preemptively we must be able to forecast inflation, and that can present a problem. We could rely on modeling approaches to forecast inflation, but these have not been very successful precisely because of the supply shocks that have made the inflation-targeting approach attractive. We could rely on leading indicators, but there aren't many reliable leading indicators that are not already considered in models. We could rely on the forecasts of inflation of others, but those other forecasters may have the same trouble with their models or their leading indicators that we have.I do think we could make some headway here, but it's not easy to do so. If we were to go through a pragmatic inflation-targeting exercise today, I think we would find that some added tightening might soon become necessary, though we might be able to delay for a short time. But stepping back from these specifics, I think an important early challenge for us is to learn how to deal effectively with the economic uncertainties, perhaps by inflation targeting or perhaps in some other way.

      "not matched:  \f18 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. You are talking about Quemoy? [Laughter] MR. JORDAN. That, too! I'm suggesting that we be open to facilitating--not intervening, I know--in such a case by engaging in an off market transaction that would result in a reduction of our holdings of assets denominated in foreign currencies in exchange for taking their holdings of U.S. government obligations into our portfolio. I wouldn't want us to preclude the idea that those types of transactions could be done. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I think that issue really ought to be on the agenda for one of our early Treasury lunches with the new administration. We bring it up every once in a while with the hopes that they will rationalize their policy. And we might as well keep trying. Are there any further questions with respect to the euro diversification issue that's reflected in Peter's memo? I hear no objection, so I assume that you could proceed with that. We need a vote on domestic operations. VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Move approval of the domestic operations. MR. PARRY. Second. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection. Also, in my enthusiasm to welcome our new member, I forgot to ask for a motion to approve the minutes of the previous meeting and I do so now. Would somebody like to move approval? SPEAKER(?). So move. SEVERAL(?). Move approval. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection. Let's now move on to the staff briefings and the Committee discussion. I call on Dave Stockton and Karen Johnson. MR. STOCKTON. In putting together this forecast, we had to address two central questions: First, is the economy really slowing? And second, how much does it need to slow in order to prevent inflation pressures from\f19building? To jump right to the bottom line, our answer to the first question is, yes. And our answer to the second question is, not by as much as we previously thought.Let me turn first to the question of the extent of the slowing in economic growth in recent months. At the time of the last forecast, there were only tentative signs of the deceleration in activity that we were projecting. Since then, the evidence of slowing has accumulated. Indeed, if anything, we have been surprised more often than not on the down side. It still would be premature to declare with confidence that a durable step down in the growth of output has arrived, but the odds of that event are looking considerably higher than they were a couple of months ago.For one, the job market appears to have cooled noticeably since last winter. To be sure, some of the slowing of private payroll employment growth probably just reflected a shift in the seasonal timing of hiring induced by warm winter weather and strong overall activity. And, no doubt, there have been more than a few instances in which hiring has been held back by a lack of qualified workers. But given the breadth of the slowdown and the absence of any apparent upward pressure on the workweek that might be expected to accompany widespread worker shortages, we believe that a slowing in labor demand has been the more important factor underlying the recent drop-off in the pace of hiring.On the spending side, tighter monetary policy appears to be leaving its clearest mark on housing activity. Starts of single-family homes have trended down since the beginning of the year, and the permits data give us little reason to discount this decline. Combined with a drop-off in sales of new homes and weaker prices and production of construction materials and supplies, the data paint a reasonably consistent picture of softer demand in this sector.Much the same can be said for motor vehicles. After the astounding pace registered earlier this year, car and truck sales have slowed considerably--albeit to merely a very strong pace--and inventory overhangs have developed for a few models. At present, the automakers are dealing with these spotty problems by raising incentives and moving quickly to trim production where necessary. Indeed, a drop in assemblies contributes importantly to our projected second-half deceleration of real GDP.Outside of the auto sector, real PCE slowed sharply in the second quarter, and, although we are forecasting a larger gain in the current quarter, the projected increase in spending remains well below that seen late last year and early this year. But here I'd have to admit that, with consumer confidence remaining elevated and with only one month of data in hand, this\f20key element in our outlook remains more forecast than fact. Given our view that the impetus to spending from wealth should be waning after about 8 months of relatively flat equity prices, we are comfortable with the underpinnings of our consumption forecast. But the more subdued pace of spending that we are projecting is far from baked in the cake.In contrast to the signs of slowing in household spending, business outlays for capital equipment have continued to surge ahead. One of the most notable aspects of the recent annual revision to the national accounts was that the investment boom of recent years is now estimated to have been even stronger than previously thought. Moreover, there are few signs, if any, that higher real long-term interest rates have put an appreciable dent in the demand for equipment and software. It just doesn't look like this boom is about to dissipate any time soon.This brings me to the second question: Does the economy need to slow? We still think the 6 percent pace of the past four quarters is not sustainable. But because of our supply-side revisions, that pace is not as far above potential growth as before. With the revised data showing a higher level of investment and with the near-term indicators pointing to continued strong growth in capital outlays going forward, we found ourselves forecasting an economy in which the growth of capital services will be high and increasing. Moreover, the annual revisions portray a pattern of greater acceleration of actual labor productivity, with the annual increase through the second quarter of this year in excess of 5 percent. There are a number of reasons for discounting the extent of the recent pickup in the nonfarm business figures, but any way we look at it, the performance of productivity has been phenomenal.Taken together, these observations motivated our upward revisions to the growth of structural productivity and potential output. Indeed, given both the mounting contribution from capital deepening implied by our investment forecast and some further improvement in the growth of multifactor productivity, we are projecting a modest ongoing acceleration of structural productivity--3-1/2 percent this year and 3-3/4 percent in 2001, up about 1/2 percentage point from our last forecast.The revision to structural productivity not only affects potential GDP, it also has important implications for the demand side of our forecast. In particular, it boosts the growth of real incomes and spending and is the chief reason that we have adjusted up our real GDP growth forecast by a half percentage point in 2001 to 4 percent.This outcome might seem somewhat surprising in light of many of the simulations we have shown you in recent years. In those simulations, faster\f21trend productivity growth typically caused growth in demand to outstrip that of the productivity-enhanced growth of supply, at least for a time. As you will recall, an important channel for that effect came through the influence of faster productivity growth on asset values and, consequently, on consumption and investment. But our interpretation of recent events is that while we hapless economists have been only slowly marking up our forecasts for productivity growth, the markets and private-sector agents had already been anticipating this improvement. Thus, we are not looking for any additional increment to spending from a further productivity-driven rise in the stock market.On net, our revisions to the demand and supply sides of the forecast were nearly a wash for resource utilization. In this projection, we anticipate the unemployment rate to rise to about 4-1/4 percent by the end of next year, just a bit above our June forecast. By our assessment, this remains too low to prevent a further gradual deterioration in inflation. For this reason, our forecast assumes some further tightening of monetary policy next year, as core inflation drifts higher.Of course, major question marks continue to surround this element of our forecast. But we read the incoming wage data as suggesting that labor markets remain extremely tight. Virtually all of the data on hourly compensation have come in to the high side of our June forecast--decidedly so in the case of the ECI, which outstripped our second-quarter forecast by nearly a percentage point at an annual rate. Although we have carried only a bit of that surprise forward in our projection, we expect to see continued upward pressures on compensation.That said, these upward innovations to our wage forecast have been more than offset by our faster estimated structural productivity growth, which has acted to damp the rise in unit labor costs. As a result, the uptrend in price inflation is more gradual than we were previously projecting. We now anticipate that core PCE price inflation will move above 2 percent by the end of next year, a couple of tenths below our previous forecast, though still nearly ½ percentage point higher than its current pace.Obviously, a wide range of uncertainty attaches to many important elements of our forecast. But the changes that we have made to this projection bring into sharper focus the risks associated with our investment forecast. We are projecting some slowing in equipment spending from its recent pace in response to rising interest rates and some deceleration of final sales and profits. If the slower growth of earnings that we are expecting to accompany a period of below trend economic growth came as a significant disappointment to businesses, there could be a sharper retrenchment in capital spending than we are forecasting.\f22The largest and most immediate effect of that retrenchment would come on the demand side of the economy, especially as multiplieraccelerator effects amplified any slowing of capital spending. Reduced investment would also attenuate the productivity-enhancing effects of capital deepening on the supply side of the economy. All in all, any serious scaling back of investment would risk some unwinding of the virtuous cycle of investment, productivity, and price restraint from which we benefited in recent years.With the return to capital having been well maintained despite an investment boom that has lasted more than five years and with no signs that business demand for new equipment is letting up, we are reasonably comfortable with our forecast of continued strong investment spending. But clearly, this is an area that will bear close scrutiny in the period ahead.There are also upside risks to demand associated with our outlook for the supply side of the economy. As I noted earlier, we have assumed that much of the good news on the supply side already has been discounted by the markets. If we are wrong, and the enthusiasm of investors is rekindled by the pace of productivity growth envisioned in this forecast, a Fed perceived to be on hold, and no marked near-term deterioration of inflation, then a snapback in equity markets, with the accompanying consequences for faster growth of private spending and higher resource utilization, could present a more difficult environment in which to make policy.Karen will now complete our presentation.\n",

      "not matched:  \f24 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry. MR. PARRY. Karen or Dave, the new Greenbook assumptions for potential growth and your forecast for actual GDP growth are, I believe, way above the market consensus if one looks at the Blue Chip forecasts, for example. What do you think the chances are that the baseline forecast may actually be accompanied by a stronger foreign demand for our capital and also a stronger dollar? It seems to me that that would be the most likely outcome, given these changes in the assumptions in the Greenbook forecast. I think this is particularly important since, as your alternative simulation indicated, that would take some of the pressures off inflation. MS. JOHNSON. It certainly is a reason why we thought this was the right time to include that alternative as opposed to some other alternative. Nevertheless, it's not unlike the problem David described with respect to the stock market. Will 4 percent growth in 2001 come as a big surprise to everybody? In that case, a range of asset prices might adjust, including the U.S. stock market as well as the dollar. Will it come as a surprise to some but not to others, and will it have a differential impact on assets? We can't rule that out in some sense. We've often seen news move the bond market and stock market in ways that don't seem entirely consistent. To be honest, I don't know. I can tell you that most of the public forecasts that I've seen do not have U.S. net exports in the current account widening the way we do in 2001. And when I look to see why, it's because those forecasts have much lower U.S. growth than we have. So I have to believe that outcome, if it materializes, is going to be a surprise to some forecasters. But whether it will be a surprise to investors is something we really have a hard time judging at this point. MR. STOCKTON. Just to follow up on that: I indicated in my remarks that we hapless economists are slowly writing up our forecasts for productivity growth. I think the Blue Chip\f25 forecasters may be even more hapless than we are. Those forecasts suggest considerably lower potential output growth than we have. That just doesn't seem consistent with what one hears.\n",

      "not matched:  \f18 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. Questions for our colleagues? MR. PARRY. Dave, over the past year the core CPI is up about 2-1/2 percent and the core PCE is up about 1.7 percent. Part II of the Greenbook suggests that the difference between these two indices is almost exclusively due to the imputed prices for non-price services like bank services. Given that, which index do you think is providing the best indication of core inflation? MR. STOCKTON. I don't know whether that's a leading question or not! [Laughter] Actually, as we have said in the past, I believe it would be a mistake to rely on any single index. So, what we have tried to do in our analyses is to present some of the pros and cons of the various indexes for you, as policymakers, to consider in order to reach some kind of a judgment. My judgment would be that there has been a pickup in underlying core inflation. But the core PCE has probably understated that pickup because of these imputed prices, which are more statistical constructions than actual measurements. It's quite conceivable that the CPI has overstated that acceleration in part because, as we have noted, we have some doubts about the weighting structure of the CPI. Another source of discrepancy between the PCE and the CPI over the last year has been that the CPI is showing a much sharper acceleration in medical services prices than the PCE, which uses a PPI measure rather than the measure used in the consumer price index. I think there are some questions about the quality of the medical care prices as measured in the CPI. So if I can weave my way to an answer, I'd say that a rate somewhere in between those two measurements probably captures the right sense of what has been going on.\f19 MR. PARRY. On medical care, of course, businesses tell us that they have seen huge increases over the last 12 months in terms of their costs. I'm not saying which one looks as though it's-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. But you're talking about cost, not price. What's happening is that the physical volume of medical care is going up very dramatically. MR. PARRY. The usage has risen. But there's no doubt that when we budget for premium increases that we charge our employees, the increases are huge across the board. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. But a good part of that is improved medical care because the technology is moving at a very rapid pace. And it's pretty obvious that the actual health insurance premiums reflect far more than price. MR. PARRY. Sure. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Indeed, there's a very serious question among a number of analysts in this area as to whether medical prices actually have been going down, not up. But there's no question that the dollar amounts are very large and very bothersome. MR. STOCKTON. And there is no doubt that, in some sense in our forecast, the increased costs associated with higher medical care insurance premiums being paid by employers do feed back through on the cost side of the equation into prices. Whether or not it's prices or quantity-CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Through compensation? MR. STOCKTON. Yes, through compensation. MR. PARRY. Thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow.\f20 MR. MOSKOW. David, I had a question for you about productivity. We all know that labor markets are very tight now by historical standards and that productivity is increasing at very high rates by historical standards. We're in this slowing growth period now and anticipating some further slowing going forward. I wonder if you've given any thought to--or done any analysis on--whether the cyclical slowdown in productivity will be any different this time, given that we're starting at such a low unemployment rate. Also, have you thought about whether this is going to affect the way we can separate out the structural productivity from cyclical productivity? MR. STOCKTON. I'd say we've given more thought than hard-core analysis to this question. Obviously, one could imagine that we would see a greater cyclical weakening in productivity in tight labor markets, as firms perhaps would be very reluctant to shed workers given how hard it was to get these people on their payrolls. So that would be one argument for an even sharper deceleration of cyclical productivity, perhaps, than we are showing in this forecast. That could, then, have consequences as well for corporate profits. On the other hand, we don't know very much about how the cyclical behavior of the labor market might have changed in recent years as a result of structural changes in the labor force. Another factor is the ability of firms, in essence, not to pay the high fixed cost of workers by using more temporary workers to provide a cushion, making it easier for them to implement hours adjustments in response to a slowdown than they have in the past. It could very well be this time around that firms would just be calling up the temporary help agencies and saying, in effect, \"Don't send us as many workers this week as you gave us last week.\" In that case, there would be less of a cyclical response. Now, what makes this so difficult to estimate at any aggregate level is that the\f21 last time we had a cyclical occurrence was 10 years ago. And the previous cyclical occurrence was 10 years prior to that. In essence we have two observations since 1980 on this issue, a period in which there has been a lot of structural change. So we have very little confidence that we really have a good handle on this. We're just trying to feel our way through as we watch what is happening. So, I think there's a wide band of uncertainty, but you're hitting on an important element in the forecast going forward from here.\n",

      "not matched:  \f41 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer. MR. MCTEER. Like that for the nation, the economy in the Eleventh District has begun to show signs of slower growth during the past couple of months. Both the energy and high-tech sectors have been positive factors recently but growth in the computer, electronics, and communications equipment industries has tapered off in recent months. Labor shortages continue to restrain growth in many sectors. For example, in October the oil and gas rig count in Texas was 368, up 35 percent since the beginning of the year, but employment in that sector is up less than 2 percent over the same period. For months now, energy industry contacts have reported difficulty in hiring workers who have plenty of opportunity in other safer and more stable industries. To cite an anecdote that may be indicative of hiring pressures in the industry: More than 10 rigs were shut down in the Midland/Odessa area in recent raids by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. If the INS policy of benign neglect were to end, employment growth in Texas and many other regions could slow or reverse significantly, especially in construction, hotels, and restaurants. All sectors of the economy that are sensitive to interest rates, oil and gas prices, and tech stocks are showing signs of slowing. Moreover, we have noticed a fairly sharp mood shift to the down side. The mood has deteriorated much more than the economic data. That shift in mood was noticeable between our September and October board meetings and then again between our October and November meetings. Several directors mentioned that retailers are expecting a weak holiday season and thus have been holding back on inventory accumulation. It seems likely under these circumstances that weak December sales could become a self-fulfilling prophecy.\f42 Signs of slowing at the national level are becoming more widespread. Pipeline inflation has cooled in recent months. The price of gold has fallen to the mid-260s; the prices of many key commodities have fallen. The dollar remains strong. And the PPI for crude and intermediate goods remains well below the PPI for finished goods. Tighter credit standards by banks and tighter conditions in the capital markets are reinforcing the already slower growth of demand. In these circumstances, the risks have shifted significantly and are at least as large, if not larger, on the down side as on the up side. It's getting to the time when we as a Committee need to recognize and prepare ourselves as well as the markets for the possibility that the downside risks in the economy have escalated and may need to be addressed in the near future. I say that for a lot of the reasons that Tom Hoenig put on his list. So, I favor moving to balance in the risk statement of the press release. And for the record, my guess is that our next move will be an easing move. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus. MR. BROADDUS. On balance, Mr. Chairman, our District economy is growing at a slower pace currently than at the time of our last meeting, although activity is still at a very high level. And labor markets in our region, as appears to be the case elsewhere in the country, are still very tight. According to retailers we survey each month by mail, sales were strong--very strong, actually--through early October but have weakened fairly markedly since then. Car dealers in particular have seen their sales drop off and customer traffic has diminished. That was in October, however; I should point out that in September their activity was very strong. Furniture dealers and home improvement stores also report somewhat slower sales. Looking ahead to the holiday season, most retailers tell us they expect a reasonably decent season, but\f43 they certainly aren't looking for anything like the strong performance they had last year, and a number of them are pretty nervous.Elsewhere, manufacturing activity in the Carolinas, where it is concentrated in our District, has decelerated lately. Both factory shipments and orders were notably softer in October than earlier in the year. In contrast to the softening in manufacturing, though, generally demand in the services sector is still holding fairly steady and in some cases is even stronger, according to a majority of the services firms that we have talked to over the last several weeks. As far as labor markets are concerned, basically the story is the same as it has been. Qualified workers still are very hard to come by throughout our region. We are told that some retailers have actually had to cut back on the hours they are open because they can't find people to staff their stores. Also, a board member who runs a hospital in Charlottesville, Virginia, told us that they actually are delaying some non-emergency surgeries because of the shortage of nurses. We don't see any broad breakout in wages yet, but my sense is that wages are creeping upward on balance throughout our region and that the pattern is pretty pervasive across a broad array of industries and companies.On the national scene, the data that have come in since our October meeting indicate a national picture similar to the regional one I just summarized, and we've heard that assessment around the table today. Overall spending, housing activity, and business investment are all growing more slowly than in the first half of the year. And I think the perception of softer demand, as we've heard here this morning, has broadened and deepened. The October labor market report does provide some evidence that the slowing is continuing into the fourth quarter. Jobs grew in October at about the trend rate of growth of the labor force, but the index of\f44 aggregate hours worked changed little from the third-quarter average, indicating for now at least that aggregate demand may be growing somewhat more slowly than potential output. So I would agree with others around the table who have said that for the first time in a couple of years there is now some significant downside risk as well as upside risk in the outlook for the real economy. And I would underline \"real economy.\"Now, focusing more on prices and wages, the moderation in demand might seem to suggest that the inflation threat is now abating. But I don't think it's clear yet that that is the case, especially when one looks at labor costs and wage and benefit figures. Wage growth in October jumped to an annual rate of about 5 percent, well above the 3.6 percent average rate for the year to date. And with the persistent tightness in labor markets, the ECI was up 4.6 percent over the last four quarters. I believe that's the biggest four-quarter increase in ten years; it compares to only 3.1 percent in the previous four quarters. Also, productivity growth in the nonfarm business sector did slow to 3.8 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter. I agree with Bob Parry that it could have been worse, but it was a drop from 6.1 percent in the second quarter and about 5 percent on average over the last year or so. As a result, unit labor costs rose at a 2-3/4 percent annual rate in the third quarter after remaining roughly flat for an extended period--in fact, over the four previous quarters. I think that's worrisome, and in my view unit labor costs could increase further. The continuing labor market tightness could easily cause compensation growth to rise more and productivity growth might slow further. In that regard, I think it's notable that for the first time in a long time, Dave, you have revised downward your structural productivity projections--not by a lot, but it's a change in direction. And I think we\f45 could see a slowing in cyclical productivity growth along the lines suggested by Michael Moskow's questions.So, while aggregate demand appears to be growing more slowly--and I think that's clearly constructive from the standpoint of the longer-run health of the economy--the bottom line for me is that I believe we are still a long way from a soft landing. And I don't think we should take one for granted. Oil prices are high and core measures of inflation have risen 1/2 percentage point. I was struck, Dave, by your comment about your sense of the underlying direction of core inflation. Again, the labor market is still exceptionally tight. In this situation, I think an actual or anticipated further rise in the growth of unit labor costs could readily provoke an increase in inflation expectations. Like many others around the table--and I thought Jack Guynn said it especially well--I think the risks are clearly still on the up side. And I believe we need to be positioned to deal with those upside risks going forward. Thank you.\n",

      "not matched:  SPEAKER(?). We're getting on a bit from that period! VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. The West, after being subservient to a predominantly and powerful Islamic world, began to modernize. The Islamic world had a choice of either competing or of retreating into religion and an unwillingness to modernize. That has continued ever since. Iraq is the seat of civilization as we know it, never mind Islamic civilization. It is the great intellectual leader of Arab and Islamic thought. A successful war in Iraq, if it were to bring about a change in Iraq that looks anything like a modern regime, would have a great shock effect of the rest of the Arab/Islamic world. What we don't know, first of all, is whether the change would just involve Saddam being replaced by a more benevolent general, in which case there would be very little effect. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

The Second District economy has been mixed but generally weaker since the last report. The labor market has softened noticeably. Housing activity has retreated, but manufacturing conditions have improved a bit. Retailers report that holiday season sales were generally sluggish, marked by very steep discounting but decent unit sales. Consumer confidence fell to a cyclical low in December. While unemployment rates in the District were mixed in December, private-sector employment retreated sharply, mainly reflecting reductions in retail holiday staffing. Sales of both single-family homes and apartments slowed noticeably in the latter part of the year, but selling prices remained well ahead of a year earlier. In part what I think is going on is that people are unwilling to accept real prices and therefore are slow to sell. That will have to\fJanuary 28-29, 2003127 of 195change. New home construction also retreated in October and November but remains at a fairly high level. Office markets in downstate New York were relatively stable in the fourth quarter but office vacancy rates in New Jersey and Connecticut continued to escalate. Manufacturers and purchasing managers report mixed but generally improving conditions in the last few weeks. The state and local governments in the area are considering ways to close sizable budget gaps projected for the upcoming fiscal year, and they are doing it at this stage with varying degrees of realism. I mentioned at the last meeting the possibility of a very crippling transit strike. That fortunately did not take place. Bankers are reporting increased loan demand from commercial borrowers as well as tighter lending standards on that segment of their business. They also note a widespread retreat in consumer delinquency rates.On the national picture and the international picture, I am by nature an optimist, and therefore I am very inclined to think that the Greenbook forecast, with which we largely agree, is a quite reasonable one and is likely to take place. But we do have an enormous amount of uncertainty. So the question is, What does the prudent central banker do in an atmosphere of enormous uncertainty? It seems to me that one should think very hard, do nothing, and stay extremely alert. Now, if fortune is kind and the large degree of uncertainty is dissipated, I share the view that when we begin a policy move it is likely that boldness will be appropriate--more along the model of January 3, 2001, than the 1994 example. But that is a decision that we will make appropriately at that time. Thank you.\n",

As the Chairman has indicated--I'm sorry to talk out of turn without being called on. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. You're called on. MR. FERGUSON. This concept really is very much about a growth rate that is close to potential. Now, potential growth is in a range that we've never been public about, and I'm not sure we all agree that it's currently somewhere between 3 and 3½ percent. MS. MINEHAN. Right. MR. FERGUSON. I believe the staff still considers potential to be in that range, and I think all of us generally understand that that's what we mean here. The reason we've chosen this language is that we've been using these words for a long, long time. They go back to the era of the Humphrey-Hawkins legislation. In my view, it's better for us to stick with those words rather than to say a growth rate about equal to potential because that clearly begs the question of what we think the rate of potential is. The word \"sustainable,\" at least to my ear, has an implication of a pace of economic growth that, as the Chairman suggested, does not contain the seeds of its own destruction. It means growth that is not too slow, which is what we have now, nor so far above potential that we risk a breakout of inflation. Admittedly it's shorthand. But I don't think it's that mysterious that we need to tie ourselves in knots about it today. To make the\fMay 6, 200396 of 115point again, this little swan that we tried to hatch a few years ago may need to have some plastic surgery. But I'm not sure that today is the day we ought to look closely at this because what we mean by sustainable growth is not the issue that has tripped us up with respect to this whole concept. At least I would argue that. You may disagree.\n",

We should clearly avoid any sense--and somehow try to correct the belief--that we sit around this table trying to figure out what the markets are likely to do and what we're going to say to make them do something different. The markets are going to do what they're going to do. We have to make our policy the way we call the cards. We may be right, or we may be wrong; but we should not be making policy--or even talking about policy--that's aimed at changing how the markets operate. They have to operate a bit independently of us, I think. So in the short term I think we did the right thing today. Between now and January we probably will be coming to an appreciation of the risks being more balanced. That will change the language. That will help us get out of the \"considerable period\" terminology. In January-- my personal preference is to take a real step back and think long and hard about what the risk statement does for us. If we're convinced that it does something good, then we have any number\fOctober 28, 2003104 of 126of formulations of language to go with. If we're not convinced, then maybe we can find a way to tell the markets that they will find out what we did and why, but we're going to stop speculating on the risks.

      "not matched:  SPEAKER(?). With speed limits. MS. JOHNSON. For various reasons their economy has been growing around 4 percent at times and rather consistently. Now, in England, I think there is an enormous tension over the housing prices on the one hand and other prices on the other. Not all prices are rising. There's a sense of the service sector of the economy versus the manufacturing sector of the economy. One monetary policy just won't do for the United Kingdom anymore, but of course, they can have only one monetary policy. So there is a certain tension there. But I think in the international setting it has become clear that, depending on the inflation situation and the macroeconomic picture more broadly, some central banks need to be acting now and some do not have to yet. But I have not detected a sense that the reason the dollar is being sold is that we're failing to address an emerging inflation problem. I have certainly heard often--and Dino may confirm this--that the Australian dollar is one of the currencies that has appreciated the most against the U.S. dollar, so just the interest differential in the normal course of transacting is looming in people's conversations. MR. KOS. There is a minority that would say that the low interest rates here are affecting the dollar. They would also say that that doesn't mean that our policy isn't the right one. It's just that one of the side effects of having that policy is that the dollar will depreciate.\fDecember 9, 200338 of 133\n",

Mr. Chairman, I have a question and a comment. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Certainly. MR. POOLE. I didn't see a reference in the memo to a warehousing limit, but maybe I missed it.

There is a $5 billion warehousing limit, which is a part of the package of authorizations and instructions under which we operate. That limit was mentioned in the memo. MR. POOLE. That's in there. So there's a $5 billion limit? MR. KOS. That's right.

By law the only thing that was required was monetary aggregate targets. And this was appended to those targets partly because the Committee was supposed to say how the monetary aggregate targets lined up with the Administration's economic forecast. So this was a way of working around that as well. The only thing in the law right now is that we are supposed to give some sense of likely future developments. MR. OLSON. I think the wording is a discussion of \"prospects.\" MR. KOHN. Right, \"prospects.\" MR. OLSON. The memo mentions the question of whether or not an MPR without a forecast would comply with the law. That's an open question. MR. REINHART. It was an open question because the Committee had established a precedent and they interpreted \"prospects\" to mean these forecast numbers. But the issue isn't whether you will be sued; it's whether you'll get a worse outcome when the Congress pushes back. MR. FERGUSON. Let me close this because we want to get on to something else.

      "not matched:  SPEAKER(?). What do you think we ought to do? [Laughter] CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, I had an hour and 27 minutes worth of comments prepared, but basically let me just say this: I think the reason we're having these sorts of difficulties is because we're running into what I suspect may well be the tail end of the stimulus that has occurred in the world economy from extraordinary changes in globalization in the past 10 years. The best way to see that is to look at how the pattern of the propensity to invest domestic saving in domestic investments has changed. That's because one of the best measures of globalization is essentially the correlation coefficient between pairs of domestic saving and domestic investment by country. One way of stating it is to use the terminology of home bias--to look at the extent of home bias that exists in the world. Starting in the early 1990s, home bias began to break down. We've seen a broadening effect, which arguably has been the major factor in creating a disinflationary environment. And that essentially has enabled us to have this extraordinary period of economic growth, productivity increase, and remarkably low rates of inflation. Coupled with that, obviously, has been a partially, but not wholly, independent change in technologies that has allowed unit costs to move lower.\fMarch 22, 200588 of 116I suspect, but do not know, that we may be nearing the end of that process. We are now looking at a different model, at least for the United States, given the fiscal policy problems that we will have as we get into the next decade. And remember that the latter tranches of the 10-year Treasury note are moving into that decade enough to impact on rates currently. My suspicion is that we're going to see real long-term rates and real mortgage rates begin to move up and that the capital gains we have seen in both the stock market and in housing values will become a lesser source of funds for borrowing. There will be less financing using realized capital gains--or, indeed, even unrealized gains--and that will have a significant impact on consumption expenditures.Remember, 15 to 20 percent of personal consumption expenditures do not relate to income; they are the consequence, at least econometrically, of the wealth effect. Therefore, a significant amount of personal consumption expenditures has been financed; and it looks from the way the balance sheets are coming out, that these expenditures have been financed largely from mortgage debt. The big rise in mortgage debt has essentially been the source for putting into cash for consumption purposes a fairly significant part of capital gains.Real long-term rates may go up. It's hard to forecast, but looking at the long-term fiscal situation, I'm not exactly optimistic, especially in light of what happened last week. The likelihood that the fiscal problems will be addressed has weakened. I believe Governor Gramlich characterized it quite appropriately. So I think the longer-term issues essentially are beginning to guide us now with respect to the shorter term.In my judgment, the median forecast for the United States is reasonably well captured in the Greenbook; and it may indeed be the mean forecast. I would even venture the possibility, although it's arguable, that the probability distribution of these outcomes may, in fact, be roughly symmetrical. But what is not symmetrical is the loss function. As I think Cathy Minehan mentioned\fMarch 22, 200589 of 116earlier, if we were to become a bit more aggressive in tightening policy in this context and it turned out to be wrong--in other words, if actual unit costs and price inflation simmer down a bit so far as core inflation is concerned--the damage to the economy and to policy would not be all that great. It is obviously negative in the sense that the outcome is different from what one expected--but not compared to the policy problem we'd run into if we maintain a posture that presupposes the median outlook, namely, the Greenbook outlook, and we are wrong. In the latter case, I think the costs would be great and the damage very difficult to recover from.For those of us who remember how we struggled in 1994 with the pattern of adjustment and how we were trying to get ahead of the curve--and eventually had to move 75 basis points in one month--I trust the memory is such that we don't want to go there again. We were very fortunate that we got a soft landing in 1995, but it was fortune, not great policy. We may have thought that we tried in advance to communicate to the market that we were going to move in February 1994. They were not listening, and we ran into all sorts of difficulties.Therefore, I conclude at this particular stage that we have to start moving in the direction where our previous conversation left us. So I would recommend a move in the funds rate of 25 basis points and the alternative B language that is in this vector.\n",
